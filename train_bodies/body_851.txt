Not only has the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic likely found an actor to play Jobs, it may have found an actor to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak too: according to The Wrap, Seth Rogen is being considered for the role. Variety reports more definitely that he's actually set to play it. Rogen would be acting alongside Christian Bale, who is reported to have taken the part of Jobs. Danny Boyle, who made Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, is directing based on a script by Aaron Sorkin. Jessica Chastain is also reported to be under consideration for a part, though it isn't known who she would be playing.

THIS ISN'T A DONE DEAL YET

Rogen is certainly an interesting casting choice, but with how little is known about this movie, it's hard to really gauge what it means. For one, it's not clear how large the role of Wozniak will be: the film is supposed to take place in the moments preceding three major Apple product launches, and Wozniak wouldn't necessarily be around for all of those, having left Apple in 1985. We've also seen successful pairings of strong dramatic actors, like Bale, with traditionally comedic actors, like Rogen, in the past to quite a bit of success — see last year's The Wolf of Wall Street, for example — so it's possible that Boyle is trying to emulate that here.

That all said, The Hollywood Reporter says that it isn't clear if an offer has been made to Rogen yet, but that the film's producers do want him on board. The Reporter also says that Bale's deal is yet to close and remains at a delicate stage — though Sorkin has suggested that he's on board. This Sorkin-scripted Jobs film has had a rocky development process and has already had to restart once, when David Fincher was dropped from being its director. Still, it's sounding more and more like the studio behind this film is eager to get it made, so perhaps we'll see some confirmation on all of this soon.
