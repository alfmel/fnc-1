North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un is considering opening a restaurant in Scotland.

His government’s Pyongyang chain of diners already has a branch in Amsterdam.

And the Supreme Leader’s interest in the Scottish independence referendum means Scotland is high in his thoughts. Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.”

He said the restaurants were one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.
