The Pentagon admitted on Wednesday that ISIS did in fact get its hands on one of the 28 bundles of weapons and medical supplies that the U.S. dropped to Kurdish forces on Monday. Two of the bundles had missed their marks, but one was destroyed by the U.S. According to a Pentagon spokesman, the wind caused the parachute to go off course. The spokesman also stressed that the weapons will not give ISIS any advantage. Past reports have indicated that humanitarian and military aid has made its way into the hands of the terrorist group.
