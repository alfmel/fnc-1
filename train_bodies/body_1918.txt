MEXICO CITY — Rumors about the death of Fidel Castro — an age-old ritual for Cuba-watchers — once again began circulating on and off the island this week.

It’s true that Castro hasn't been seen in public in about a year, and it’s been a few months since one of his last columns were published. Castro, 88, has not said one public word about the historic announcement by President Obama last month about his goal of moving toward normal relations with Cuba after a half-century Cold War stand-off.

Twitter went wild Thursday night with speculation about his demise. Why? There are rumors about that, too. One of them is that another Fidel Castro, this one the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died a few days ago (Fidel Castro Odinga of Nairobi), and maybe this was all a social media mash-up of mistaken identity.

Also, an Argentine Web site reported that foreign press in Havana had been summoned to a news conference — presumably to announce the huge news — but this turned out to be false. On the island, there was more talk this morning that Fidel’s brother, current President Raul Castro, would be speaking today at noon, but that came and went in silence.

Instead, Cuban state media has been promoting a round-table interview with the three members of the “Cuban 5” who were released from U.S. custody as part of the prisoner swap.

The Cuban government hasn’t spoken one way or the other about Fidel Castro’s health in recent days.
