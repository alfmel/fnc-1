(Source) A neighbor tells 8 News NOW former baseball star Jose Canseco was hurt in an accidental shooting Tuesday afternoon at his house on the eastside of the Las Vegas valley. Metro Police confirm there was an accidental shooting at the address, but would not confirm the former player was hurt. However, records show Canseco owns the home where the shooting happened.

 

 

Vintage Canseco. World Series Game 6, NBA opening night, the Boz On ESPN, all eyes not on Jose Canseco, whoops there I go shooting myself and stealing the show, clumsy me, can’t believe that happened!

 

You can tell me it was accidental but I know better than that. The consummate showman, that’s what Canseco is.

UPDATE – Shot or Drone attack?
