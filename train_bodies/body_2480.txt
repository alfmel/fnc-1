A tour of the royal grounds at Buckingham Palace went through the looking glass when so-called “magic mushrooms” were found in the garden, The Telegraph reports .

The discovery was made while a television crew was touring the gardens in preparation for an ITV television show called The Queen’s Garden, which will air on Christmas day. While taping the show gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh and ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley noticed some red and white spotted fungi. Titchmarsh asked, “Is it edible?” and, according to The Telegraph, Professor Crawley replied, “That depends what you mean.”

The fungus found in the Queen’s garden was a naturally occurring Amanita muscaria (no one suspects Queen Elizabeth II of cultivating the magic mushroom) that according to Prof. Crawley is “eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.” The fungus, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, does have hallucinogenic properties, but it is not the same as the illicit psychoactive mushroom that contains the illegal drug psilocybin. Still, Titchmarsch wisely replied, “I won’t be eating any of that.” Titchmarsh told The Sun that he was surprised to happen upon the red and white-headed toadstool, “That was a surprise, but it shows just how varied the species are.”

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of the Amanita muscaria. It is understood that the mushrooms grew naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there. Palace officials made it clear to the AP that mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens.
