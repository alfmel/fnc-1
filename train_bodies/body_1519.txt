First, there was #BendGate. Reports flooded the media that claimed the iPhone 6 Plus was susceptible to bending when kept in your pocket.

Now, there's #HairGate. A 9to5Mac community post reveals that iPhone 6 customers are complaining on social media that their new phones keep ripping out chunks of their hair when they hold the phone up to their ear to take a call.

Twitter users claim that the seam between the glass screen and aluminium back of the iPhone 6 is to blame, and it's that gap that their hair is getting caught in.

This news follows #GapGate, which focused on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Customers complained to Samsung that their new Android phones had a gap between the screen and the case. It's unknown whether Samsung customers are also experiencing hair-loss when taking calls on their phones, as some iPhone 6 users are now reporting.
