The rodents have pestered the staffs of Vanity Fair and Vogue. Conde told employees that they cannot eat at their desks and that a complaint will be made with the cityâ€™s health department.

Conde Nast's rat problem is getting worse rather than better.

While Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter tells Confidenti@l that rats stubbornly continue to occupy the new Conde Nast offices at One World Trade Center, we're also told that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour doesn't even want to go in the building anymore.

And while there were multiple previous reports that the pests were terrorizing the glamorous staff at Vogue, we're now told they've "taken over" more of the storied publishing house.

Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, no longer wants to enter the building because of its rat problem.

Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter said rats continue to occupy the new Conde Nest offices at One World Trade Center.

"A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard," said a different source. "They ate through his rug to fit under his door."

We're told that Conde has sent a memo to their staff in the building telling them that "they cannot eat at their desks" and that a complaint to the city's health department is next on the agenda.

When we bumped into Carter outside the tower, where the publishing house set up shop in November, we asked him if the little beasts are disgusting as we've heard. "They're rats!" laughed the legendary editor, "What do you think?"

The Durst Organization, which manages One World Trade Center for the Port Authority, declined to comment.

Reps for Conde Nast did not respond to requests for comment.
