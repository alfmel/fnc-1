Tiger Woods' agent responded Monday to inflammatory allegations made by little-known pro Dan Olsen, who said on the Mad Dog in the Morning radio show last week that Woods is serving a suspension for a failed drug test.

"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false," agent Mark Steinberg said. "They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous."

On Monday morning, the PGA Tour responded to the claims.

"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations," said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.

Woods is on leave from the PGA Tour as he tries to sort out issues with his game, especially with his chipping. Woods, who said he would not return to the Tour until he can compete with the best in the game, missed the cut in the Waste Management Phoenix Open in his first tournament of the season – shooting a career-high 82 in the process – and then withdrew with a stiff back after 11 holes the following week in the Farmers Insurance Open.

Woods said his back problems are not the reason for his hiatus from the game, nor are they related to the injuries that forced him to have back surgery last March 31.

"I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this," Olsen said Friday on the radio show. "Well, it's not testosterone, but it's something else."

Olsen also said Woods was using untested equipment.
