A hoax report filed by website nationalreport.net claimed the infamous artist had been arrested in London during a raid on his art studio.

The website – which describes itself as "America's No.1 independent news source" – said a man named Paul Horner from Liverpool had been nicked.

They even had the cheek to say both the BBC and a representative for Bansky had confirmed the news.

To complete the tale they quoted "London police chief" Lyndon Edwards who apparently held a press conference to announce the arrest. A press conference apparently attended by no reporters or TV crews.

HOAX: The false report claiming Banksy had been arrested [NATIONALREPORT]
Most hilariously of all the article was written by one Darius Rubics who has "won numerous awards for journalism including a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize".

Despite the ludicrous nature of the article some fell for it hook, line and sinker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch, never shy of sharing her opinion with the world, said: "You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy?

"There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?"

She did later apologise after being duped.


There are so many problems with the hoax we've decided to list some of the best ones for you.

– The article claims Banksy is from Liverpool when all known evidence strongly suggests he is from Bristol.

– Other articles by Darius Rubics include: Dennis Rodman leaves US to talk with leaders of ISIS and Obama declares November national Muslim appreciation month.

– London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards doesn't exist. The top cop in London is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

– The article suggests Banksy was nicked in Watford which actually falls under the catchment of the Hertfordshire Police.

– In Britain police do not release mugshots of people after they have been arrested.

– Banksy's PR Jo Brooks, despite apparently being quoted in the original story, has tweeted saying it is a hoax.
