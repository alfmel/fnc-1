Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos, the New York Post reports.

The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service.

The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).

Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: "We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. Weâ€™re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service."

At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.

Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.
