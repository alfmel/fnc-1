Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

The three Marines join other members of their unit and head off to track down the “Taliban sniper” before the video ends. The footage was uploaded two weeks ago and has been viewed more than 610,000 times.
