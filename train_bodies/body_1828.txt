Another nun who had no idea that she was pregnant surprised her mother superior and sisters as she gave birth to a baby boy recently, according to the Daily Mail.

The South American nun belongs to an order in Macerata, in the eastern Italian region of Le Marche. She arrived there last June, and people suspect now that she was already pregnant by the time she was admitted.

She was rushed to the emergency department of 'Bartolomeo Eustachio' di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters after she complained of a severe stomach ache, and doctors immediately deduced that the nun was about to give birth.

She soon delivered a healthy baby boy, but the child currently remains in the hospital to undergo more checks. The Macerata nuns have expressed their desire to keep the baby and raise him. For her part, the nun said she had no idea that she was pregnant prior to her hospital admission.

This is not the first time a nun has mysteriously given birth after suffering from stomach pains. The South American nun's case is very similar to what happened to a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun, also in Italy last year. She complained of unbearable stomach pain, was rushed to the hospital, and gave birth afterwards. She named her baby boy after Pope Francis.

The Salvadorean nun told her social worker that she does not feel any guilt and only expressed eagerness to raise the child. "I am so happy. He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun," she admitted, according to the Daily Mail.

Back in 2011 a Congolese nun in an Italian order also gave birth to a baby girl. However, the Congolese nun's experience was different since she was raped by a priest.

She decided to give the baby up for adoption, but after she was refused re-entrance to the convent, she changed her mind and decided to raise her daughter herself.
