Jordan’s King Abdullah announced he was cutting short a visit to the U.S. following the brutal death of a Jordanian fighter pilot captured by ISIS with this photo.

The king, a former military pilot himself, joined Jordanian leaders in calling Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, who was burned alive, a martyr. The government also vowed revenge and an “earth-shaking” response.  facebook.com

Sometimes called the “Warrior King,” it wasn’t long before rumors began spreading that his majesty was going to take care of business — personally.

The images spread on social media…

Photos of King Abdullah's first personal air attack on ISIS!

…and prompted some meme-based political commentary.

Because King Abdullah is a WARRIOR!!

Obama after James Foley beheading vs. King Abdullah after burning of Jordanian pilot:

It made a great story, but it wasn’t true, the Jordanian government said. Airstrikes did hit targets in Syria, but the king was not in the pilot’s seat.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN Thursday the rumors of the king personally launching airstrikes on ISIS targets were “creative,” but untrue.

Actually, the king was involved in some more conventional leadership. He met with officials and security leaders.

And he offered condolences to the family of the slain pilot.

The cockpit image appears to be from an October charity event, when he piloted a helicopter for children with cancer.
