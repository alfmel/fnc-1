In a bizarre twist during the filming of "Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice" in Detroit, the Batmobile (or at least one of the models) is missing! The initial assumption based on the report is that Detroit locals may have stolen it!
All initial reports point to Bleeding Cool as the primary source of the report. They did not give any specific details:
"The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of 'Batman Vs. Superman' has gone missing, believed stolen.
Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries."
The website is one of the known super hero movie sites and has been accurate in some of their scoops. However, there is no way to determine the accuracy of this claim except through the police.
One of the local radio stations affiliated with CBS Detroit Local did just that. The result along with CBS Detroit's report:
"Does this person - if the rumor is true (we don't know how credible the source is) - think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
If I see the Batmobile driving around anywhere I am taking photos. Even funnier: Could you imagine getting pulled over for going too slow in this car? No way right?
How would the cops catch it with all the Bat devices that come standard? Does Alfred come to your rescue? Is the Batcave set in the GPS? If so, you would be safe from the cops, I presume...
Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn't heard about this, but were looking into it)."
We'll keep you posted on further developments. In the meantime, be on the lookout for the Batmobile. It looks like this.
