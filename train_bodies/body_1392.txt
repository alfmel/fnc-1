Israel has rejected allegations by government officials in the Gaza strip that authorities were responsible for released storm waters flooding parts of the besieged area.
"The claim is entirely false, and southern Israel does not have any dams," said a statement from the Coordinator of Government Activites in the Territorities (COGAT).
"Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel."
At least 80 Palestinian families have been evacuated after water levels in the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) rose to almost three meters, .
The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Sunday that civil defence services had worked alongside teams from the Minsitry of Public Works to evacuate families to shelters in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighbourhood sponsored by UNRWA, the UN Relief and Works Agency.
Brigadier Gerneral Said Al-Saudi, chief of the civil defence agency in Gaza, told Al Jazeera: "More than 40 homes were flooded and 80 families are currently in shelters as a result."
He added that the flooding would adversely affect local agriculture as the area included Gazan poultry and animal farms.
A major storm in the region has brought freezing rain to Gaza and snow across parts of the Occupied Territories and Israel.
