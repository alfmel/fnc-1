An Australian man claims he had a tropical spider surgically removed from his body after discovering it had burrowed into his stomach. Twenty-one-year-old Dylan Thomas says he was on holiday in Bali last weekend when he awoke to find a mysterious red trail on his chest. He says doctors initially thought it was an insect bite but later discovered a spider inside his stomach. Thomas's story has not been verified by the Guardian and some commentators have cast doubt on his version of events
