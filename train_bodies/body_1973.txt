(ANTIMEDIA) The KFC Corporation just acquired a Colorado licence to legally sell cannabis within the state.
According to some reports, nearly half of the KFC franchises in the state Colorado began selling cannabis last month.
“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success. It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado,” KFC spokesperson William Rausch said in a statement.

 
Customers who want to buy cannabis with their genetically modified fried chicken will still need to prove that they are at least 21 years of age, with a valid government issued ID.
Interestingly enough, this weird phenomenon is something that “South Park” predicted years ago. In one episode of the hit comedy show, Randy Marsh gives himself testicular cancer with a microwave in order to get a prescription for medical marijuana. In the episode, all of the KFC locations in the town become marijuana dispensaries.
With this bold move, KFC becomes one of the first major fast food chains to offer this extra service, and it is possible that many others will follow in their footsteps. Fast food has been suffering financially in recent years, as consumers become more health conscious. While KFC may not be the best place to eat, the addition of cannabis to their menu definitely signals the beginning of a new era.
