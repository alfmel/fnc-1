ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” will not be featuring a discussion in which an all-male panel discusses domestic violence.

In fact, the telecast of the game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs will feature just a regular pregame show. There was never, the network says, a panel discussion about the topic planned for tonight.

The network was hammered with calls after an Esquire blog post (“ESPN Has a Problem with Women”) indicated that an all-male lineup would debate the topic, which has been a hot once since the second Ray Rice video surfaced three weeks ago. On Monday, in the third game since the explosive video triggered the NFL’s domestic violence crisis, “it’s a normal lineup for ‘Monday Night Football,’” according to Chris LaPlaca, ESPN’s senior vice-president of corporate communications.

That lineup, of course, includes Suzy Kolber, who hosts the two-hour “Monday Night Countdown” show, and Lisa Salters, reporter and sideline reporter. In a statement on the matter, John Wildhack, executive vice-president of programming and production, said:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.
