Kabul: A recent footage of a sniper bullet hitting a US marine on the helmet during a helicopter raid in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, has gone viral on social media.

The importance of wearing a helmet when on the field of battle has been perfectly illustrated in a video uploaded to YouTube by a US marine.

In the video, three marines are seen to move through a bunker in search of a source of gunfire. As they come near to the exit point, a bullet suddenly bounces off the Kevlar helmet of the middle soldier.

The three men then quickly retreat to the back of the building to inspect the damage to the soldier's helmet. After ascertaining that the Marine is unharmed, they regroup to consider their options.

Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold reportedly said that the video was shot while "conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013". The footage was uploaded to YouTube last month, and has since received just under 200,000 views.
