The White House fence jumper last week somehow managed to run into the building where the most powerful person in the world works. And new reports today reveal he actually made it farther inside than we thought.

An anonymous Secret Service official relayed to The Washington Post that Omar Gonzalez charged through the front door and overpowered the Secret Service agent stationed there.

He then, reportedly, ran upstairs and into the East Room (the room where President Obama generally holds receptions or gives speeches). Gonzalez was subsequently tackled by a Secret Service agent in this room.
