As far as revenge goes, this woman has it covered.

Ting Su, 29, caught her husband and twin cheating on her and followed them to a shopping centre using a mobile phone tracker.

She went to find husband Cheng, 30, who was completely naked in a car along with her sister.

They both jumped out of the car with not a thread of clothing.

But Ting saw her opportunity, jumped into the car and drove off, leaving the embarrassed pair where they stood.

Witness You Meng, 33, said: ‘It was so funny. Loads of people were grabbing their phones and I did as well. He was banging his fist on the window and shouting at her, and she just wasn’t playing ball.’

Ting has filed for divorce and revealed that Cheng and her sister had been having an affair since she gave birth to twins of her own.
