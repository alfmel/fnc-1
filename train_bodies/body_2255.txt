West, who is more famous for his marriage and storming the stage to protest when Beyoncé doesn’t win than for his music these days first caused this kind of controversy back in 2009. Yeezus stormed the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards when Taylor Swift was given the Video of The Year for “You Belong With Me,” over Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies.”
“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said while interrupting her acceptance speech, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”
On Sunday night, Kanye again took to the stage, this time when Beck beat out Beyoncé for Album of the Year. He left before he could say anything, but after the broadcast he made his feelings on that particular award very clear.
Kanye very angrily spouted off about “true artistry” and said “Beck should respect true artistry and give his award to Beyoncé.”
After those disrespectful comments, Kanye was allegedly called to task by the powers that be at the Grammys and he and his sex tape famous wife were permanently banned.
Whether this is true or not remains to be seen. It would be delightful if it was true and send a message to Kanye that he is, in fact, not the guy who gets to say who wins the awards. Beyoncé is great, but she isn’t the only artist out there
