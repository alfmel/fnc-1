We’ve all had that feeling of being jilted by our lover and many reach for the wine or chocolate.

But one dumped woman decided that she was going to gorge on chicken wings and set up camp in KFC for an entire week.

Tan Shen, 26, said that she was walking around depressed after being dropped by her lover and went into a branch of the fast food outlet in a train station in Chengdu, China.

She said: ‘I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

‘I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.’

Staff eventually realised after three days that she had not left the store and she told them that she just needed time to think while ordering another box of chicken wings and extra large fries.

They let her stay there but then when local media started to arrive to question her, she decided to leave the city and move in with her parents.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: ‘I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.’
