Along with unveiling the Apple Watch earlier this year, the company also announced that the prices for the wearable device will start at $349. French website iGen.fr now claims to have an idea about the pricing of the stainless steel variant, as well as the gold variant.

According to the publication, the stainless steel variant of the Apple Watch will be priced around $500, while the gold variant will be priced between $4,000 to $5,000. This is in line with earlier rumors, which claimed that the top-end variant of the Apple Watch will be priced above $1,000. While Apple didn’t announce which variant would be priced $350, it is widely believed to be the entry-level aluminum variant of the Apple Watch.

As for the availability, the publication claims that the first Apple Watch will start shipping by Valentine’s Day 2015. While this is in line with earlier rumors, it is in contrast with what Apple Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts hinted yesterday. In a video message to the company’s retail employees, she hinted that the Apple Watch will launch in spring next year. She said, “We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.”
