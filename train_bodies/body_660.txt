The Apple Watch has been scheduled to begin shipping in April according to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook. Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right. Either way we will be keeping our eyes and ears peeled for a possible invite, but in the meantime try not to get your hopes up just yet.
