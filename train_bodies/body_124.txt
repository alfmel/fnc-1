Some might say that no matter how rich you are, spending $2.5 million on a car makes you a total dick.

Apparently a vandal in Seattle sought to communicate this message quite literally, branding a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport—the world’s most expensive production car—with a graffiti penis while it was parked on the street.

The car boasts 1,200 horse power, tops out at 252.97 miles per hour, and was named car of the decade in 2010 by BBC show “Top Gear.”

If you can afford one of these, you can probably afford a new paint job. Still, guy must be pissed.
