Does Russia have better smartphones or are Russians just better photographers under pressure – like when a Yeti walks directly in front of them?
Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.

The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual. However, some video viewers say the Yeti walks too much like a human to be real. Others point out that this is a tourist area and any Bigfoot sighting is sure to increase the number of visitors (and possibly raise property values).
