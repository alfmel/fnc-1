Macaulay Culkin is dead? The Home Alone actor was the victim of a celebrity death hoax this week.

A fake news story was published at a fake website this week claiming that Macaulay Culkin was found dead at his apartment.

The fake news story reads: “Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.”

This led to an “RIP Macaulay Culkin” Facebook page and numerous tweets from people mourning the loss of the world’s greatest child actor.

But if Macaulay Culkin was found dead at his Manhattan apartment on Friday afternoon, how was he playing a show with his band the Pizza Underground on Friday night?

Macaulay Culkin hasn’t released a statement yet about his current life-status but the several photos of the actor on the band’s Twitter account prove that he’s alive and well.





Of course, Macaulay Culkin isn’t the first celebrity to be “killed” by the internet. In recent months, Hulk Hogan, Chumlee, Chris Brown, and Sylvester Stallone have all been victims of a death hoax.
