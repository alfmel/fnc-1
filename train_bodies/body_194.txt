BEIRUT: Lebanon's interior minister said that DNA tests have confirmed that a child held by authorities is the daughter of the Islamic State group's leader.

Nohad Machnouk also says that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was married to IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi six years ago for a period of three months. He says they are no longer married.

Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television late Wednesday that Iraq sent Lebanese authorities DNA samples from al-Baghdadi to test against the woman, identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, and the girl.

He said the girl and two other children detained with al-Dulaimi are being held in a child care center.
