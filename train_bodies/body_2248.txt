SEVEN girls, aged 13 to 15, have fallen pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls fell pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.
