While it has not been verified, an alleged audio recording of the shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed teenager shot down by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, has surfaced:

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.
On the tape, you can hear six shots being fired, a short pause and than an addition four or five shots. An autopsy report released last week said that Brown was shot at least six times.
