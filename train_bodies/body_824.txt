Henry Jackson, better known as Big Bank Hank of the Sugarhill Gang, died early Tuesday morning at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey from complications due to cancer. The news -- first reported by TMZ -- was confirmed to HuffPost Entertainment by David Mallie, business manager for Sugarhill Gang members Michael "Wonder Mike" Wright and Guy "Master Gee" O'Brien. Jackson was 57 years old.

In a statement to HuffPost Entertainment via Mallie, Wright and O'Brien expressed sorrow and condolences: "So sad to hear of our brother's passing. The three of us created musical history together with the release of 'Rapper's Delight.' We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank."

The Sugarhill gang formed in the late '70s and was best-known for the 1979 hit single, "Rapper's Delight."
