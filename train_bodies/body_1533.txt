Is the iPhone 6 ripping out hair? Maybe. Photo: Courtesy of Apple
By now, you’ve probably heard about #hairgate, which has people chattering about an unintended problem with the iPhone 6. According to a forum post on 9to5Mac, Apple’s latest phone traps hair in the seam between the glass and aluminum. “When you try to free it out, it hurts,” the poster laments.

Sounds like a pain, but aside from some tweets, is there any real evidence of the iPhone ripping out hair? That depends on who you ask. As Mashable demonstrates in a video, it just doesn’t seem to be happening. A variety of men and women — some with short hair, others with long hair — tested the new iPhone by taking calls, rubbing the device on their beards, “combing” their curls with it. Not a one experienced pulling or snagging. Meanwhile, enterprising YouTubers are uploading videos that demonstrate exactly the opposite effect. (#Hairgate truthers, perhaps?)
All of it adds up to a lot of outrage, with #hairgate getting thousands of tweets as well as a Today segment. It’s true that when you drop a few hundred on a new gadget, you’d like to think it won’t gobble up your hair. Considering the severity of this alleged injury, though, we can’t help but think of another hashtag: #firstworldproblems.
