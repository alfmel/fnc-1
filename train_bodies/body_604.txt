Want to buy a private island previously owned by Tiger Woods? Hey, here’s your chance!

The Telegraph reported Tuesday that Woods' former 62-acre island in Lake Malaren, Sweden, has been put on the market. 

The listing agent for Vladi Private Islands says the island, about an hour from Stockholm, features one golf hole in addition to a “mini mansion,” secluded villa, hunting lodge, private barber and landing strip for propeller planes. How convenient! 

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods,” the listing agent said, “but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden anymore. This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. … 

“The protected location, combined with the quay’s generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.”

Interested? The price is only available upon request, but something tells us private islands don't come cheap.
