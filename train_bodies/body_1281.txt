On Thursday evening, thousands of people took to Twitter to share the #MacklemoreJoinedISS, mercilessly trolling the 9/11 truther based on a bogus tweet.

No, Macklemore has not joined the ranks of ISIS.

While the notorious Syria-based terrorist organization has allegedly recruited the likes of Deso Dogg, a Berlin gangsta rapper who’s popped up in a handful of ISIS beheading videos—and is reportedly being used as a recruitment tool—the mild-mannered “Thrift Shop” rapper has not followed suit.

On Thursday evening, the #MacklemoreJoinedISIS became the top trending topic on Twitter worldwide based on the strength of a bogus tweet that was circulated (and retweeted, and retweeted) through the Twitterverse, eventually going viral.

The 31-year-old Grammy Award-winning rapper—and recent father—formerly known as Ben Haggerty has supported a number of progressive social causes, including marching in Ferguson protests in his native Seattle and having a bunch of gay couples be married (by Madonna, no less) during his Grammys performance of “Same Love.”

On the opposite end of the sociopolitical spectrum, he's also a 9/11 truther who, on the track “Bush Song” off his 2005 EP The Language of My World, rapped the following: “Where’s Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq / Findin’ some oil to tap, tell ’em I got up on that / And y’all still think it was bin Laden / When it was us and the Masons, plottin’ on oil profits.” The 30-year-old followed those bars up with the following tweet, which he unleashed in 2009:

911...bush knocked down the towers

And back in May, Macklemore took it upon himself to dress up as an anti-Semitic Jewish caricature, sporting a giant prosthetic hooked nose, dark beard, and bowl cut wig, during a surprise performance at Seattle’s Experience Music Project.

The Twitter world, including actor Seth Rogen (who is Jewish), was not amused:
