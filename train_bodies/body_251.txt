Apple is hosting its ‘Spring Forward’ event tonight, where it will finally be answering the many questions surrounding the Watch. The Cupertino-based giant however is not resting on its laurels, and is reportedly already working on the next-generation Watch.

According to Wall Street Journal, Apple has “studied platinum watch casings,” which could be the material of choice for the luxury edition of the next-generation Watch. For the current Watch, the most expensive variant will boast 18-Karat gold plating. While Apple hasn’t revealed any details about the pricing, reports claim that it could go up to the $20,000 mark.

Considering that luxury watch makers like Rolex and Omega use platinum for their high-end watches, it seems like a logical step up for Apple as well. But the publication mentions that Apple has only been “studying” the materials, and this is by no means a confirmation about a platinum Watch variant.
