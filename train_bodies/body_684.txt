I don’t know if you heard, but supposedly an actual Batmobile was stolen from the set of Batman v Superman yesterday. Seriously. No official word has come down from the powers that be with the film, until Zack Snyder’s latest Star Wars tease.
Strange that GCPD cracked the case before Batman did. Maybe he was just boosting their egos.
