TYRANT Kim Jong-un is trying to boost his love life by necking litres of snake wine.

The slippery despot has bought up cases of the pricey plonk – with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle – delivered to his palace in North Korea.

Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improves the size of your manhood.

Kim, 31, and his wife Ri Jol-su, 22, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight.

He recently stepped out in public eye for the first time in several weeks and insiders said it was due to health problems from his size.

The ruler’s waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky.

One North Korea expert living in Seoul, South Korea, revealed: ”The elite in the country joke that he is now too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.

“One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department but nothing seemed to be working.”

Kim, who has a two-year-old girl called Ju-ae, is a fan of the bizarre brew which is made by placing the reptile in a jar of distilled alcohol and aging it.

Locals says that the more deadly the snake, the more powerful the booze.
