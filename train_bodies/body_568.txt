A woman who claims she was Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps’ girlfriend before he checked into rehab has allegedly just dropped a big bomb.
Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, told Radar Online that she was actually born a male — and she never told Phelps.
Chandler, whose birth name was David Roy Fitch, told the website that she was an “intersex baby,” with partial male and partial female genitalia. When she was a teenager, she started going by Paige Victoria Whitney and later underwent surgeries to become a woman.

Chandler said she met Phelps, 29, on Tinder in August. He eventually invited her over to his place in Baltimore to watch a Ravens game in September and that’s when things went to another level.
“One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,” she told Radar. “Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.”

Chandler said she did eventually come clean, or at least try to, by sending Phelps an email after he entered rehab in October following his arrest for drunk driving. He reportedly has yet to respond.
As for their future together, Chandler basically said she’s hopeful but not counting on anything.

“Michael is a brand, and dating someone like me may not be the best thing,” she said. “I just hope he follows his heart and not what his people tell him.”
