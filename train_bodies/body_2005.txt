Yes, rape is a serious offence and I support that anyone caught should be seriously dealt with, by the government though.


Suresh Kumar castrated in India

However, these Indian lynch mobs took laws into their own hands after they caught 40-year-old Suresh Kumar trying to rape a girl in a dark area in Ganganagar city of India.

He was severely beaten by lynch mobs who heard the girl's scream for help as Suresh attacked her.

After he was mercilessly beaten, Suresh was dragged to a nearby butcher's shop and a meat cleaver was used to chop of his manhood.

As if that wasn't enough, his manhood was dropped in the middle of the road as he was left to die.

Medics however intervened and rushed him to a nearby hospital where he's said to be in critical condition due to excess loss of blood.
