So it wasn’t just “discomfort” that’s been troubling North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un? Kim is being treated in a hospital because he has become so fat that his ankles fractured under his own weight, according to a report in The Telegraph that was attributed to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. The portly 31-year-old absolute ruler had to undergo an operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a grueling round of official engagements, the report said. Kim, who is about 5-foot-9, is believed to have ballooned to more than 280 pounds, apparently due to an unhealthy diet that’s said to include imported Swiss cheese and heavy drinking. Bodyguards are said to have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he’s being treated. Just a few days ago North Korea admitted Kim was suffering from “discomfort” amid speculation that he had gout.
