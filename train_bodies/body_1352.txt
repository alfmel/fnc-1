J.J. Abrams' heavily anticipated "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is currently slated to open in theaters this Dec. 18, 2015. But if there's truth to these recent release date rumors, the sequel could be hitting the cinemas on an earlier schedule.

An article from The Telegraph cited two separate "unconfirmed reports" from Ikwiz and Movie Pilot indicating that instead of winter, Star Wars VII might arrive in theaters "this summer."

"J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching," Movie Pilot wrote.

Ikwiz meanwhile stated that "Disney is reportedly taking Abrams' request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release."

This conclusion was apparently drawn from the statement which the "Star Trek" helmer gave off during the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) event on Feb. 4 where Abrams received the VES Visionary Award.

John Boyega, who is set to appear in the "Star Wars" sequel, recently shared his appreciation for the brilliance Abrams has put in the gigantic film project.

"It was brilliant," Boyega told BBC. "J.J. Abrams is obviously a passionate guy and does well in this movie and I can't wait for it come out."

As for the movie itself, the 22-year-old quipped that fans should really brace themselves when it arrives.

"I think they should be very excited," he added. "We're going back to the originals, we're staying true to practical effects and we have the original cast back, and it's going to be a great time."
