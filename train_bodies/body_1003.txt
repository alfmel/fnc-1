No one has died more times than Fidel Castro.
But yesterday, rumors began flying anew in the Cuban-American community -- and, of course, on Twitter -- that the Cuban leader has finally bitten the dust and that a possible news conference will announce his demise today. Could the speculation finally be true this time?

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes "suspiciously close" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

There is another reason the rumors may be swirling: According to Fox News Latino, yesterday marked one year since the 88-year-old revolutionary was last seen in public.

Let's hope Fidel himself jumps on Twitter soon to deny -- or confirm? -- the rumors.
