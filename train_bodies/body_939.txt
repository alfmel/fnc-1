The “Jihadi John” killer who has featured in several Islamic State beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle-class family who grew up in London, the BBC and the Washington Post newspaper reported Thursday.

WHAT THE VIDEOS SHOWED

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons. He was made famous in a video showing the death of American captive James Foley in August of last year.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST AND BBC ALLEGE

WHY DID HE JOIN ISLAMIC STATE?

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London. They said Emwazi and two friends – a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib – never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster.

WHAT POLICE SAY

Police declined to comment on the reports. “We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counterterrorism investigation,” said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.
