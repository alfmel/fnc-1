Washington (CNN) -- The man who jumped the White House fence earlier this month and breached the building's doors actually made it farther than originally thought, the Washington Post reported Monday.
Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who had a knife in his pocket, overcame one Secret Service officer and sprinted all the way into the East Room of the White House, where he was then tackled, the Post reported, citing "three people familiar with the incident."
Secret Service officials had previously told reporters that Gonzalez made it to just inside the north portico White House doors.
The Post reported that Gonzalez ran through much of the main floor, past a stairway that leads up to the first family's residence, and was ultimately stopped at the far southern end of the East Room. He also reached the doorway to the Green Room, an area that looks out on the South Lawn.
The Secret Service has not yet commented on the Post report.
