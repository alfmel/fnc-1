AN American journalist who has been missing for almost two years has reportedly been executed by the Islamic State (IS).

James Wright Foley went missing in on November 22, 2012, while reporting from Syria.

But a shocking video apparently shows the 40-year-old being beheaded by IS (formerly known as Isis) forces.

Before the execution a masked man dressed in black stands over Foley as he is forced to read a letter labelling the US government as his killers.

He says: "I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality."

The journalist is also then made to address his brother John, who is a member of the US airforce.

He says: "I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate."

The militant group is now also threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff, unless Barack Obama calls a halt to US attacks.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in 2013 and last tweeted on August 3 that year, when he was understood to be in Libya.

The executioner claims Sotloff's fate "depends" on President Obama's "next decision".

IS has seized several key Iraqi cities, including the country's second largest city, Mosul.
