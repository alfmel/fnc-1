Talk about a story to make your skin crawl.
Australian Dylan Thomas, 21, was on vacation in beautiful Bali, Indonesia, when his body was invaded -- by a spider that had burrowed under his skin.
He awoke one morning to find a mysterious red trail stretching up his abdomen, which continued to creep higher throughout the day.
“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he told Darwin, Australia-based NT News.
Concerned, Thomas visited a hospital, where he was told it could be a small insect bite.
“So according to the doctors over here I've come down with some mystery condition,” he said in a Facebook post on Oct. 12 that included a photo of the scar. “Tad scary.”
Later that day, Thomas posted another photo that showed the scar beginning to ooze.
“It was a searing burn,” he said.
Turns out, it was a match-head-sized tropical spider that had burrowed into Thomas’ skin through his scar from when his appendix was removed recently.
“Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily,” Thomas wrote in a follow-up Facebook post, showing off his freshly bandaged scar. “Haven't felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it's all over.”
While the experience literally got under his skin, Thomas has remained in good spirits throughout the ordeal, if his Facebook posts are any indication.
“Still hoping I'm going to develop superpowers by the time I'm home,” he wrote, joking about his fitting new nickname, Spider-Man. “I'll be highly disappointed if I haven't . . . Until the next time catch you later Bali.”
