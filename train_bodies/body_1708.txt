Word that Durex was rolling out a pumpkin-spice-flavored condom swept through social media over the weekend:

The autumnal-themed birth control may well be just an internet invention, a riff on Starbucks’ wildly popular coffee drink. The photo in the tweet above appears to be an altered version of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” range of condoms, which come in apple, strawberry, banana and orange, but not (yet) pumpkin. There have been no corporate announcements about any new offering.
Several emails to Durex’s parent company, Reckitt Benckiser, and Virgo Health, the PR company that handles communications for Durex, didn’t yield a conclusive answer. A spokeswoman for Virgo Health said she couldn’t say whether the company was or was not actually developing such a thing.
Reckitt Benckiser has been growing the Durex brand in emerging markets, as Quartz reported earlier, and transforming it into a “sexual well-being brand.” But plans for any holiday-themed contraception remain mysterious, or possibly imaginary, even ones involving a certain cult cinnamon and nutmeg-laced spice flavor.
