A video of a US marine surviving being shot in the head by a sniper in Afghanistan in 2013 is being shared across the internet.

The description on the YouTube clip claims the incident took place during a raid in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province.

The video shows the marine being struck on the helmet by an unseen sniper during the raid.

Afterwards the US serviceman tells his colleagues he is fine, other than a ringing in his ears.

The video was uploaded on 26 September by Sam Arnold, who has been described as an Afghanistan veteran.

BuzzFeed News has contact Arnold for a comment on his incredible video.
