(Nov. 26, 2014) – Your Thanksgiving turkey is perfectly safe. There is no nationwide turkey recall. You don’t have to worry about an Ebola-infected bird.

Both of those rumors spread this month across social media.

The fake turkey recall first appeared on a satirical website called “National Report.” The article quoted the CDC as saying millions of turkeys were unsafe because of avian flu.

The USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service went on Twitter to debunk the hoax, saying the agency would post any real recalls on its website.


Snopes.com—the premier debunker of internet myths—said the article was fake.

And the folks at Snopes.com have been talking turkey plenty this month.

On Nov. 10, a website posted an article claiming more than 250,000 turkeys at a Texas turkey farm had been infected with Ebola. The article claimed an employee had been on the job for three days after experiencing Ebola symptoms and potentially contaminated several turkeys.

The turkey farm—“Texas Prime Turkey Farm”—doesn’t exist anywhere in Texas, Snopes.com found. In addition, the website that posted the story (“Daily Buzz Live”) frequently spreads outrageous stories and false claims.
