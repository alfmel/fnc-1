Evander Kane and the Winnipeg Jets appear to be hitting a wall in their relationship, which could result in the team trading the young winger.
Kane, 23, has been the subject of trade rumors for the past few seasons, and may finally be on the move prior to the March 2 trade deadline.


 	With three-years left on his contract, beyond this season, at an annual salary of $6 million -- his annual cap hit is $5.25 million -- Kane is an extremely valuable asset, presumably in need of a change of scenery.
After scoring 30 goals in the 2011-12 season, Kane has yet to break 20 goals. It should be noted that in the 2012-13 shortened season, due to the lockout, Kane was on pace for 29 goals.

Kane has also battled injuries, which has hindered his ability to perform on the ice.

But that's not what concerns the Jets. What concerns the Jets is his off-ice activities.

Kane was scratched from Winnipeg's last game against Vancouver, in front of his hometown family and friends. As the Winnipeg Sun reports, the decision to sit Kane out of that game has set off alarm bells, once again, for the Jets.

According to TSN Hockey Insider Bob McKenzie, the Jets and Kane may have finally hit a "crossroads" and the organization may have "come to realization they need to go their separate ways."

The Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers have expressed significant interest in Kane in the past, and both teams could renew discussions with the Jets, if GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is willing to entertain offers.

But the Jets aren't willing to move Kane without a significant return coming back their way -- presumably in the form of a top-six forward, a prospect and a draft pick.

Trade talks should pick up between now and the trade deadline, but that doesn't necessarily mean a move will be made by March 2. The Jets could wait until the off-season to explore moving Kane.

In 37 games with the Jets this season, to date, Kane has registered 10 goals and 12 assists for 22 points.
