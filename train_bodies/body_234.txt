Christian Bale will not be playing Steve Jobs in the upcoming movie about the Apple co-founder, Hollywood Reporter reports.

Sources say the actor decided he wasn't right for the role, and withdrew.

This is coming after the movie's scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed that Bale would be playing the prickly tech icon, saying the actor didn't even need to audition.

No word if this'll affect Seth Rogan's negotiations to play Steve Wozniak, but this throws a huge wrinkle into the Danny Boyle-helmed adaptation of Walter Isaacson's critically acclaimed biography of Jobs. If they get desperate to bring Ashton Kutcher back into the turtleneck, we'll know things have taken a dark turn.

Who would you rather see play Jobs? I liked Bale for the role, but my backup choice is Stanley Tucci, if they can age him down somehow for younger scenes. Or Bradley Cooper, who has the right kind of nervous energy to spit out Sorkin's rapid dialogue. [via Hollywood Reporter]
