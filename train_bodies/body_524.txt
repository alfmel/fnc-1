Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.

The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.
