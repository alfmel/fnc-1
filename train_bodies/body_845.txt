It was an embarrasing moment for a Russian TV actor when he found out that his testicles have been stolen. Dmitry Nikolaev was drugged by someone after he left the Moscow theatre.

30-year-old Nikolaev remembers being approached by a 'young blonde woman' and he agreed to go with her for few drinks. After that he got up next day and found himself lying in a pool of blood.

Doctors told him that his testicles have been surgically removed by someone with medical knowledge. It is believed that a gang selling human organs could be involved. The probe is on.
