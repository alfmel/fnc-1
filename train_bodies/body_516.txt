A married Russian TV star woke up one day to discover his testicles were missing.

The actor had been drinking with a young blonde woman in a Moscow bar before he blanked out and woke up missing the body parts.

He believes he was drugged after taking the woman to a sauna, enjoying a beer and then kissing her.

Dmitry Nikolaev, 30, woke up the next day in a bus stop in a lot of pain with blood staining his clothes.

He was taken to hospital and told his testicle had been removed in what was described by doctors as medically-educated surgery.

Russian police fear a gang seeking to sell organs on the black market could be behind the incident.
