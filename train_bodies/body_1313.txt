Earlier today, the Detroit media reported on rumors that the Batmobile had been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set. It turns out that the rumors were just as absurd as they sounded.

The ironic part is that the unfounded rumors actually triggered a real police investigation. After receiving inquiries from the Detroit media, the Detroit police department contacted producers of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice to inquire if the Batmobile had indeed been stolen.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody issued the statement, “The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs.”

And for those that might claim any type of police cover-up in regards to the theft of the Batmobile, the Detroit Free Press also confirmed with sources close to the production that the Ben Affleck’s ride had not been stolen.

Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on March 25, 2016.
