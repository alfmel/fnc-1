Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. The saying came true for a Macedonian man who chopped off his penis and threw it in the dustbin after he was dumped by his girlfriend for the lack of bedroom skills.

According to a report by The Mirror, the man told medics he felt his small-sized penis was to blame for the split.

Oliver Ilic, 22, said his small penis was useless so he decided to cut it off.

He called doctors after he could not stop the bleeding.

The jilted lover was taken, on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans, to a hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with the single swipe of a razor blade.

Surgeons sewed the member back after a five hour operation but said it was too early to know whether the penis will work again.
