On the same day Michael Brown was buried, a Ferguson man released what he claims to be new evidence in the case.
CNN is reporting that the audio is from an unnamed man who says he was having a video chat with a woman when shots rang out on August 9.
In the recording, as the man speaks to the woman, a quick series of shots can be heard in the background, followed by a 4-second pause and then another quick succession of shots.
CNN reports that forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots—a cluster of six, followed by four.
Twelve shell casings—all from police weapons—were recovered at the scene.
Lopa Blumenthal is an attorney for the man who made the recording.
“At the time, he didn’t really realize the importance of what he was hearing until afterwards,” she says.
CNN says they are unable to independently verify authenticity of the tape, which has been turned over to investigators.
