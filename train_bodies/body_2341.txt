Is Macaulay Culkin dead? No, he isn't, but the Internet would like everyone to believe he's dead yet again. The Hollywood Reporter stated on Nov. 8, 2014, that Culkin has been the victim of yet another celebrity death hoax. No matter how many times the Internet may claim him to be dead, he just keeps on living and quietly enjoying life.

An article from a fake MSNBC website actually claims that the 34-year-old child star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. It states that a wellness check was requested by a family member and police went over to check on him and he was found dead. There is even a fake quote from the police.

"The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today," said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

As rumors started being believed by those on social media, Twitter users began posting their mourning messages and condolences. This is the second time this year that people have believed the "Macaulay Culkin is dead" hoax and about the fifth time in the past two years.

The first time it happened was back in April of this year and there were memorial Facebook pages showing up all over the place. His reps soon debunked the rumors and let the world know that Culkin was alive and well.

So far, there has been no word from his reps about this Macaulay Culkin death hoax, but there have been no confirmed reports that he is dead either.
