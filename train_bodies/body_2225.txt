LONDON — The North Korean embassy in London has denied  reports on Scottish media sites on Monday that it is planning to open an state-backed restaurant in Scotland.

"I think that is fabricated, it’s nonsense," a spokesman in the North Korean embassy in London told Mashable.

North Korea Leadership Watch's editor Michael Madden, who is a frequent visitor to the communist state, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

"It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland," he said, according to the Daily Record. "The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts. Despite voting 'no,' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency."

In September, Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of pro-North Korea newspaper Chonson Sinbo, told The Telegraph that North Korea has quietly endorsed Scottish independence.

"I believe that every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality," Choe said. "And I believe that a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence."

North Korea has restaurants in parts of Asia as well as one branch in Amsterdam, which are used to funnel foreign currency back into the regime's treasury. The restaurants have existed for years in parts of China, while expansion to other parts of Asia began in the early 2000s.
