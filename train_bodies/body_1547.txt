A picture of a letter to parents from a box of Lego in the 1970s is going viral after being uploaded to Reddit.

To Parents.

The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The image was uploaded by Reddit user fryd_ on Saturday morning. He spoke to BuzzFeed News about it:

I came across the pamphlet whilst playing Lego with my niece & nephew at their Grandma’s house and it struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago. I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!

Lego famously had egalitarian advertising in the 1970s and 1980s, this poster is from 1981.

Sounds like a familiar message…

BuzzFeed has reached out to Lego for a comment on the letter.
