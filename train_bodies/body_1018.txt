A female teacher who slept with a 16-year-old male pupil was rumbled after he sent a secret WhatsApp video of the encounter to his friends.

Lucita Sandoval, 26, was apparently unaware the unnamed student was using a camera phone to document the incident until after they had started having sex.

He later promised he’d deleted the 23 minute video but had actually sent it around on the app, with it soon making its way on to a porn site in Argentina.

In the video the 16-year-old boy who was wearing a soccer shirt is seen smiling enthusiastically and giving the camera the thumbs up symbol before panning around to show he is having sex with the teacher.

Sandoval had previously faced disciplinary hearings at her school in the city of Santiago del Estero over inappropriate relationships with students.

Until now there had been no consequences as nothing had been proven but she now faces the sack.

The woman who is teaching English at the school has so far not commented on the scandal and is currently on suspension from work.

Update: It has now been discovered that the woman in the video is not a teacher and the ‘boy’ featured in it is actually a university student in his 20s.
