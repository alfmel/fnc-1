Apple crushed its introduction of the Apple Watch yesterday in Cupertino, but while Kevin Lynch and Jony were waxing poetic about the design of watch and its revolutionary UI, there was one feature everyone steered clear of: battery life.

Other than introducing the new inductive charging cable, Apple was mum on how long its timepiece will stay charged. According to a report from Recode, that’s because Apple is still trying to improve it ahead of the early 2015 release, but sources say Apple Watch battery life currently last about a day, and will require nightly charging.

Apple staff in the hands-on area after the show also wouldn’t provide battery life estimations either, but Apple PR spokeswoman Nat Kerris told Recode it should last you throughout the day.

“There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day. We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”

Barely squeaking out 24 hours of use will surely be a disappointment for some users, but it’s on par with most other smartwatches on the market. No word on if the two different sizes will have different battery life as well. The Apple Watch is expected to go on sale in early 2015 at an introductory price of $349, while the Sport and Edition models are expected to cost more.
