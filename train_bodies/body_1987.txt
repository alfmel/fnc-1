So much for idle millennials: a 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School student known around campus for spending his lunch breaks flipping stocks has reportedly amassed a $72 million fortune.

The student, Mohammed Islam, is profiled in this year’s edition of New York magazine’s annual treat, “Reasons to Love New York.” Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants, and he and a few other pint-size, hobbyist traders and poker players appear to have created a cool nerd gang for the ages—dining at Morimoto and Mari Vanna, where they toss back apple juice and caviar. They want to make a billion dollars next year (stay tuned). “But it’s not just about money,” Islam said. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers.”

One of Islam’s friends, whom the magazine describes as “the son of a Kazakh oligarch,” peppers the profile with references to The Wolf of Wall Street and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but Islam seems to have a decent head on his shoulders, Koch brothers identification notwithstanding. He’s also somewhat of a comeback kid: after losing some money trading penny stocks at age nine, he swore off trading until he felt well versed in the principles of the game. Now look at him.
