Yesterday, we reported on a rumor from Bleeding Cool that someone in Detroit had stolen one of the Batmobiles being used for filming in the city. The rumor took off all over the web, even making its way to Detroit's local CBS affliate. Our article did pretty well, probably because we found that sweet MTV contest video from 1989, showing this plot has been in motion for twenty-five years.

But there's just one problem... it didn't happen. The Detroit Free press checked with police spokesman Michael Woody, who said, "The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs." He then exited the room and promptly removed a rubber mask, revealing himself to be The Joker in disguise, and laughed maniacally.
