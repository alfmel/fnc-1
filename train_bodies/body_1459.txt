The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.

It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10.

Anyway, if you are driving around and get overtaken by this…
…do get in touch.

Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.
