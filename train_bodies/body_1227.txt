A supposed Catholic priest's claims of seeing God as a woman when he died for 48 minutes are being described as a hoax.

The Sun reported a man known as Father John Micheal O'Neal was declared dead by doctors at the Massachusetts General Hospital, near Boston, after suffering a massive heart attack but awoke 48 minutes later claiming he had seen God.

"Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting," he said.

"She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother's embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn't disturb me."

But the Church has poured Holy Water on the claims.

Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for the Archbishop of Boston, told Metro.co.uk they had no record of O'Neal being a priest.

"We do not have a priest of this name. I believe this could be a hoax story."
