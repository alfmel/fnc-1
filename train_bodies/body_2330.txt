Journeyman golfer Dan Olsen retracted claims Tiger Woods had been suspended by the PGA Tour for using performance-enhancing drugs after both the PGA Tour and Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, vehemently denied the claims. 

Olsen told ESPN.com's Michael Collins "it was only my opinon," courtesy of ESPN.com's Bob Harig. "Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any firsthand knowledge or facts," Olsen told ESPN.com. "I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview, and I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour."

Olsen certainly made several major allegations. Per Harig, Olsen claimed on 730AM The Game in Lansing, Michigan, that Woods had been suspended for a month due to the use of PEDs and that an exempt player he didn't name had revealed the information. He also claimed that Woods used a "cheater ball."

"It's not testosterone, but it's something else," Olsen told the station, per Harig. "I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy."

"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Steinberg in a statement earlier, courtesy of Harig. "They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims."

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, added that, "There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations."

However, the PGA Tour told Harig that if a player tested positive for PEDs, they were required to announce the suspension, while any punishments for recreational drugs remain undisclosed. 

Olsen's original claims, or opinions, are certainly inflammatory and it remains to be seen if he will be reprimanded

Until now, Woods has only had his character called into question by critics for his past transgressions, while his professional achievements were still held in esteem.
