The sister of British-born American photojournalist Luke Somers has said he has been killed in a failed rescue attempt in Yemen.

Lucy Somers told The Associated Press on Saturday that she learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Lucy Somers said: "We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace."

However, Yemen's defence ministry released a statement claiming that armed forces early on Saturday freed "an American hostage" being held by al-Qaeda and killed 10 members of the militant group holding him, Reuters reported.

Luke Somers was abducted in September 2013 in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This week, the Pentagon confirmed it launched an earlier failed raid to rescue him.

Somers' reported death comes as a Yemeni security official said a suspected US drone strike at dawn Saturday killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants in the country's southern Shabwa province.

Tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying nearby after the strike.
