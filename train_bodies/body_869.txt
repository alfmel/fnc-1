KLAS-TV in Las Vegas is reporting that Jose Canseco was accidentally shot in his home:

A neighbor tells 8 News NOW former baseball star Jose Canseco was hurt in an accidental shooting Tuesday afternoon at his house on the eastside of the Las Vegas valley. Metro Police confirm there was an accidental shooting at the address, but would not confirm the former player was hurt. However, records show Canseco owns the home where the shooting happened.

His post-playing career has been nothing if not weird and random. Here’s hoping he’s OK, because weird and random is one thing, tragic is another, and no one wants that at all.
