A British man who went to fight against Islamic State in Iraq has said a mother was made to eat her own son after he was kidnapped and murdered by the group.

Yasir Abdulla claimed that an elderly Kurdish woman went to Mosul, a city captured by Isis, and demanded to see him.

But he said she was fed his body.

Mr Abdulla, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, told The Sun: ‘She was determined to find her son and went to Isis headquarters and asked to see him.

‘The Isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.’

She was then given meat, rice and soup.

He continued: ‘But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said “You’ve just eaten him”.’

Mr Abdulla decided to go to Iraq after discovering that Isis had come within six miles of his home village in Kurdistan.

He said that Isis was threatening to kidnap and bury people alive unless they surrendered.

He has now returned to Yorkshire, but hopes to return to fight the terror group.
