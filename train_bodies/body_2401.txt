After multiple delays, the launch of the Apple Watch will be put off until early next year, Rosenblatt Securities Senior Research Analyst Brian Blair said Friday.

"There's really no right time of the year for this product to come out because really hasn't existed yet," said Blair. "It is kind of a strange period, but the more production gets pushed back, the later it's going to launch. It looks like right now February is the best shot they have."

On CNBC's "Fast Money," Blair said that the majority of the issues Apple is addressing with the delay are internal, one of which is battery life.

"The word is that the battery lasts for about a day," he said. "That's going to be a problem for a lot of consumers.

"If they can talk about two days, three days, where you don't have to charge it every single night when you go to bed, that will ultimately bring more consumers to the product."
