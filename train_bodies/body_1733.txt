AN AIRPORT worker has become an unwitting star on the internet after he stripped down naked in front of heavy-handed security guards.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, who works at the airport in the city of St Petersburg in north-western Russia said he had finished his shift and was going home when he remembered he had left his keys at work.

He said: “I returned back to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner. I know the rules and I know that it isn’t necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict, and security guards were just being heavy-handed.

“When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.”

Angry at officers demanding he remove the belt as requested, he had then stripped off everything in front of staff in St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airport, and then walked through the scanner with just his socks on.

The speechless officers then did nothing and allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day it was to discover that the video from a security camera had somehow been leaked and had quickly gone viral online.

A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry’s transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said they were currently investigating the breach of security.

A spokesman said: “We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.”

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video. He said: “I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me but I will have the last laugh.”
