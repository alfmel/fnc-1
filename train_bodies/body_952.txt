Forget health or messaging. The forthcoming Apple Watch could end up being a lynchpin for e-commerce.

EBay, whose website allows people to buy and sell all sorts of things both new and old, is seeking an iOS Engineer/Architect who can work on “elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app,” according to a job posting from the company.

The listing was first published on eBay’s job page in November, but it has been getting more attention thanks to its appearance on LinkedIn this month, according to a report today from AppleInsider.

E-commerce companies like Flipkart have developed apps for Android Wear watches. Now, as Apple gears up to start shipping the Apple Watch in April, e-commerce companies will presumably develop for it, too.

Apple first announced the WatchKit software development kit for Apple Watch in November.

But eBay isn’t only interested in the Apple Watch as a development platform. In addition to an Apple Watch app, eBay’s New Technology Group is planning “solutions” for CarPlay and Apple TV, according to the job posting.
