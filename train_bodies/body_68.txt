The Racket Report – KFC Gets Occupational Business License To Sell Marijuana In Colorado Restaurants.

In the state of Colorado, marijuana dispensaries are big business – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers were so appealing to the KFC Corporation, they decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.


 
The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License.

Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this “option” to their menu.

Marijuana may be purchased only by adults 21 years or older, and a picture ID is required.

Coloradans may buy 1 ounce at a time, while out-of-state residents are limited to a quarter ounce.

Due to banking restrictions, all sales are required to be cash transactions. Prices begin around $200 and up per ounce along with a 25% marijuana tax.

In addition to selling the “leafy green” they also have some yummy edibles available. They are offering Smashed Potatoes, Macaroni Munchies and Bong Time Biscuits – all made with their savory marijuana butter (sold in small amounts).

KFC is hoping to get all 100 franchisees on board with the new product by March 2016. #KushForCure
