Axl Rose Dead — Guns N’ Roses Frontman Dies In West Hollywood Home?
Don’t worry! This report is a hoax. Axl proved he’s not dead by addressing the situation on Twitter a few hours ago.


At least he has a sense of humor about the death rumor!

The fake story came from a site called MSNBC.website.com, which was designed to look like an MSNBC report. However, the two have no connection whatsoever.

The headline from the bogus story reads: “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

“Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check,” the story claims. The report then goes on to say a police spokesperson said, “The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area.”

The website pulled a similar prank in November, when it claimed Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin had died. That story also proved to be fake!
