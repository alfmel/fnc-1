Tiger Woods isn't golfing. He's taking some time off to rest, to heal, and to work on his game. But according to one dude who probably doesn't know anything, it's all a coverup, and Woods is actually serving a secret Tour suspension for a failed drug test. Today, both the PGA Tour and Woods's agent flatly deny the claim.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question! He played a single full season on Tour in 2004, hasn't played a PGA event since 2011, and now mostly caddies and gives lessons. But he had this to say:

"I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this. It's not testosterone, but it's something else. I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy."
That's a strong allegation to make, and Olsen had better be able to back it up. (He's not, but more on that in a bit.) Today, the PGA Tour said it's all horseshit.

"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations," said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.
Woods's agent, too:

"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false," agent Mark Steinberg said. "They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous."
Olsen is walking back everything he said, telling ESPN.com his Friday comments were "only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts." Which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word "opinion."

Olsen went on to say that "I'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about Tiger," and it might have been the first true thing he's said in four days.
