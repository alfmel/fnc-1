A jilted lover has chopped off his own penis after he was dumped by his girlfriend.

Oliver Ilic, 22, was told that he was no good in bed so it is claimed he mutilated himself then threw the remains in the bin.

He is alleged to have told doctors that he had a small appendage and cited that as the reason why his girlfriend was no use to him.

Ilic contacted emergency services when he could not stop the bleeding and was taken to hospital in the east Macedonian town town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also lying in the bin.

Doctors were initially unable to re-attach his penis but he was then transferred to the capital, Skopje, where it was reunited with his body following five hours of surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it would ever function properly again.

Recently a 40-year-old Macedonian man chopped off his own penis then flushed it down the toilet.
