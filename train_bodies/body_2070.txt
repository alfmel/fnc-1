A touching tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting posted on an unofficial Banksy Instagram account has been shared more than 100,000 times.

Many who shared the poignant drawing online believed it was created by the enigmatic street artist.

However a spokesman for Banksy told the Independent: "We can confirm this is not by Banksy."

The drawing is actually by French illustrator Lucille Clerc, who posted the tribute on her official Twitter page after the shooting, which left 12 dead.

Several fake Banksy social media accounts have attracted thousands of followers, however the artist has confirmed on his official website that he is not on Facebook or Twitter.

Many Instagram users commenting on the post have called for the Banksy Instagram page to credit Ms Clerc and have also shared links to her page.

#JeSuisCharlie began trending worldwide shortly after the attack, with cartoonists sharing their drawings in solidarity with the victims and in support of free speech.
