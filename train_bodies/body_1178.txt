The alleged gunman in a shooting on Parliament Hill Wednesday is 32-year-old Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, sources have confirmed to Global News.

Sources also confirmed that an investigation is underway into Zehaf-Bibeau’s connections in Calgary. 

Though little is known so far about the man alleged to have shot and killed Canadian soldier Nathan Cirillo, a Montreal criminal court database shows a man with the same name was arrested five times while living in Montreal.

Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in Feb. 2004 for possession of marijuana and possession of PCP. He pleaded guilty to both charges in Dec. 2004. He served one day in prison for marijuana possession and 60 days for PCP possession.


Zehaf-Bibeau also pled guilty to a Mar. 2004 charge of failing to respect parole conditions. He served one day in prison for that offence.

The criminal court database also shows a“Michael Bibeau-Zehaf”was convicted of marijuana possession in 2009.

A Zehaf-Bibeau was charged in Vancouver in December 2011 with robbery.

He pleaded guilty in February of 2012 to the lesser charge of uttering threats, for which he was sentenced to one day in jail in addition to 66 days credit for time served.

Court records indicate he was seen by a psychiatrist while in jail and found fit for trial.

The Vancouver police and the B.C. RCMP have confirmed they are working with the municipal police and Mounties in Ottawa, though they have declined to provide any more information.

As of 2004, Zehaf-Bibeau’s address was located in Montreal’s Villeray neighbourhood along St. Dominique.

The Ottawa Citizen reported that a Zehaf-Bibeau listed an Aylmer, Quebec address when he was charged with breaching release conditions from a previous charge.
