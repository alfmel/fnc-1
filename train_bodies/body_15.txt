Don't fucking cheat on Cassy, aka @NessLovnTrey247 (she really likes Trey Songz), because she finds out everything.

Cassy claims via a series of photos that she discovered some incriminating Twitter DMs between her boyfriend and another woman, proving he'd been unfaithful. But instead of confronting him immediately, she planned a little Christmas surprise: She printed out the evidence, wrapped it up, and gave it to him as a present.

He thought he was getting his gifts. Nah. Here's what appears to be a still from a video of the moment the trap was sprung:

Although she shamed her cheating dude on Snapchat and Twitter, she hasn't posted that video, and all the evidence here could be faked pretty easily. On the other hand, Cassy has 31,700 tweets that prove she's a real person, and the guy in the photo seems to have fessed up.

Even if it's not real, it's such a satisfying tale of revenge that 13,000 people have retweeted. All's well that ends well, I guess?
