Holy Motor City gossip! The rumored theft of the Batmobile in Detroit appears to be a false alarm.

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

Sources close to the production being filmed in metro Detroit also said it wasn’t true that the Caped Crusader’s ride had been stolen.

Buzz about the supposed theft swirled Friday when at least one comic book website reported on the “scuttlebutt” that one of the Batmobile models had disappeared and was presumed stolen.

The rumor was greeted and retweeted with smirking skepticism by some — and insert-your-own-Detroit-joke comments by others.

The Warner Bros. production has been working hard to keep its activities under wraps while filming in and around Detroit. But that’s not always easy when the cast and crew leaves the relative lockdown of the film’s headquarters at Pontiac’s Michigan Motion Picture Studios.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile have been hitting the Web this week – an unwelcome reality for studios in a world where everyone with a smartphone is a potential paparazzi. Director Zack Snyder also tweeted an official photo.

“Batman v. Superman” stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill. It is scheduled to reach theaters on March 25, 2016.
