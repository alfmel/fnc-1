The importance of wearing a helmet when on the field of battle has been perfectly illustrated in a video uploaded to YouTube by a US Marine.
In the video above, three Marines are seen to move through a building in search of a source of gunfire. As they near a doorway in single file, a bullet suddenly bounces off the Kevlar helmet of the middle soldier.
The three men then quickly retreat to the back of the building to inspect the damage to the soldier's helmet. After ascertaining that the Marine is unharmed, they regroup to consider their options.
Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold says that the video was shot while "conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013". The footage was uploaded to YouTube last month, and has since received just under 200,000 views.
