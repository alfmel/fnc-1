We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Although doctors feared that the religious cleric would have suffered brain damage, he woke up only 48 hours later and has recovered from the heart attack.

Recalling his experience, the priest apparently said that he was engulfed by a feeling of unconditional love as he met God, who he described as a mother-like ‘being of light’.

He said: ‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting.

‘She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace.

‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more.’

O’Neal has reportedly said that he will continue to spread the word of God, despite the Archbishop of Boston moving to rubbish the claims of a ‘Holy Mother’.

He added: ‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman.’
