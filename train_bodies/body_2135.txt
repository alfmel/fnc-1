Rumours that the Caped Crusader's ride has been stolen have been greatly exaggerated.

On Friday, bleedingcool.com said, "The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen."

Not surprisingly, the Internet went into a tizzy, but later that day, Detroit police said the theft was a rumour.

Sgt. Michael Woody told the Detroit Free Press that police confirmed with producers of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice that the vehicle has not been stolen.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

The paper also said that sources close to the movie being filmed in D-Town also said the fly ride had not been stolen.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile appeared online this week, and director Zack Snyder tweeted an official photo on Wednesday.

Batman v. Superman stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, and is scheduled to open in theatres in 2016.
