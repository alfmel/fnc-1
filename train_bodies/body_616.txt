Breaking news on Sunday morning reports that senior western intelligence officials confirm that the London rapper is the major suspect in the beheading of James Foley. The London rapper, Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, is the 23-year-old man believed to have beheaded Foley on the video that was seen worldwide last week, according to Fox News on Aug. 24.

Bary, who was big into the London rap scene was heard on the BBC radio with his music, but he left London last year to go to Syria and fight with the ISIS. Bary is identified as one of the group that consists of at least three British-born ISIS fighter, dubbed “The Beatles.”

The Israel Times reports today that Bary’s songs were featured on BBC radio in the past, as he was at one time a popular rapper going by the name Jinn Matic. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today.

Britain used high tech voice recognition to identify “Jihadi John,” the man seen in the video with Foley, reports the Telegraph. Bary’s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many.

Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. Barry was seen early this month on YouTube holding the severed head of one of his victims, so there’s no question about him being very capable of what many see as pure evil. The beheading of James Foley is not the end of the violence from this group warn officials.
