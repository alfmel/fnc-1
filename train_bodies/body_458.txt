British actor poised to take the lead in Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, after Leonardo DiCaprio pulled out

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.

Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles. There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”
