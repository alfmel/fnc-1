In this week's edition of lies, fakes, pranks and cheats on the Internet, we bring you a spray-painted penis on a very expensive car. Seriously.

It all began with a picture of a poorly drawn penis on the hood of a $2.5 million Bugatti Veyron that appeared on Reddit.

But as the automotive blog Car Crushing pointed out, the artwork was most likely done for a planned prank video.

Instagram user andreysmygov posted a photo of the elementary-level NSFW drawing with the caption, "How often do [yo]u get to spray paint on a Bugatti lol," crediting the TwinzTV YouTube channel and crew, who also posted photos of the vehicle mentioning a prank.

The proof:

The owner of the vehicle appears to be Instagram user gtorious, who posted another photo of his expensive car last night with the caption, "Oops I think we pranked the WORLD and the video hasn't aired...yet."

In August, the TwinzTV crew posted another prank video using the same vehicle.

Believe in nothing, Internet â€” especially penises.
