Durex denies rumors of a ‘pumpkin spice’ flavored condom.

Oh my gourd it was a hoax!

The arousal over a pumpkin spice flavored condom made its rounds on the internet over the weekend, but Durex confirmed that the autumnal-themed birth control is fake.

“Durex has heard that people are saying we launched a ‘Pumpkin Spice’ condom. We can’t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice up the bedroom,” a Durex spokesperson told BuzzFeed.

Pumpkin spice finds its way into everything: coffee, cupcakes and candles so it was no surprise that social media was a buzz when the fake photo was released.

One user tweeted, "Because safe sex is important, no matter what season it is."

The photo appears to be an altered image of Durex's flavored "Taste Me" selection of condoms, which come in apple, banana, strawberry and orange.
