The Boston Globe’s Boston.com last night pulled a story off its website that alleged a Harvard Business School professor had sent “racist” emails to the owner of a Chinese restaurant with whom he had a dispute over $4 on his bill.

Boston.com has taken professor Ben Edelman to task over the dispute in a series of stories. Last night, the website posted a story headlined: “Ben Edelman Appears to Have Sent Racist Email to Chinese Restaurant Owner. Today.”

“Could it be Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman has a problem with people of Asian descent?” the story said. It also included what purported to be the text of emails from Edelman containing a racial slur, which Boston.com said had been provided to the website by the restaurant owner.

Edelman has reportedly denied sending such an email.

He could not be reached for comment by the Herald last night.

The Boston.com story, which gained significant traction on the Internet, was replaced by an editor’s note that reads: “Earlier tonight, Boston.com published a piece suggesting Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman sent an email with racist overtones to Sichuan Garden. We cannot verify that Edelman, in fact, sent the email. We have taken the story down.”
