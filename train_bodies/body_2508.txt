28 girls, aged 13 and 14, from a small town went on a five-day school trip to the capital, Sarajevo. A quarter of them returned pregnant.

It wasn't a pregnancy pact.

Seven Bosnian teenagers became pregnant on a five-day school trip, angering parents and educators, according to public health officials.

The teens, from small town Banja Luka, are 13 and 14 years old, said Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health.

The school took a group of 28 girls on the trip to the capital, Sarajevo, to see museums and city sights, according to inserbia.info. A quarter of the students returned home pregnant.

Parents are demanding why there wasn't better supervision on the trip, according to the Courier Mail. But Babici said parents need to teach their children about sex.

The case has brought national attention to the increasing number of teen pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic said the growing rate is worrisome because teens face higher risks in both pregnancy and child birth.

"We have to be more direct in the educational system," he said. "It must not be allowed that the street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life."
