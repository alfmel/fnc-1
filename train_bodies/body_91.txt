The dedicated pet owner initially refused to pay for the procedure to save the 3-inch fish at Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk, but quickly changed his mind.

A British man forked out $460 to save the life of his goldfish — after it became constipated.

The dedicated owner took his blocked-up 3-inch pet to a vet after realizing it was struggling to pass waste, reports the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

He was stunned to be told that the delicate operation needed to solve the problem would cost $460.

Shocked at the high cost, he initially refused to give Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk the go-ahead.

But the man, who has not been named, had a change of heart and returned just 10 minutes later to give them the green light.

Vet Faye Bethell administered anesthetic to the fish, which was believed to be 2-years and 10-months old.

The 29-year-old then used a tiny scalpel to remove a lump which had grown close to its dorsal fin. After 50-minutes, the fish was handed back to his grateful owner.

"I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp," Bethell told the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

"There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets — but that was an expensive little goldfish," she added.
