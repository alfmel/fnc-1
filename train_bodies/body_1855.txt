After Lester Holt tossed to Seidel, who was covering the storms in North Carolina, the camera showed the back of the weather man, who appeared to be relieving himself in the snow.

While the camera focuses on Seidel's back for a couple seconds, a voice off-camera can be heard yelling, "Mike, turn around!" A seriously unaware Seidel then turns while appearing to zip up his pants and asks "Why?"

Holt, who looks hilariously shocked once he realizes what may have happened, then calmly says: "Well obviously Mike is not quite ready for us. Let's turn to some other news we are following this Saturday night."
