Jose Canseco certainly lives an interesting life. Reports are beginning to circulate Tuesday night that the former slugger injured himself in a shooting at his Las Vegas home earlier in the day. Details are developing, but it appears the former Oakland Athletics outfielder shot himself in the hand while cleaning a gun.


An avid social media user, Canseco hasnâ€™t filed a tweet since Monday when he posted a picture of his dogs. It will be interesting to see what he says about the incident.
