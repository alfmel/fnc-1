ANN ARBOR, Mich. – A pizza delivery man in Michigan got a huge surprise when he made a special delivery to a hotel last week.
“Rob”, the delivery driver, thought he was dropping off food for a guest, but he was escorted to a conference room where 200 Keller Williams realtors were holding their annual conference.
They surprised him with a tip of more than $2,000 plus a VISA gift card, some lottery tickets and letters of encouragement.
Rob was stunned.
The realtors said they wanted to do something special for someone in the service industry.
