Yes, we wished it were true too, but no, Fox News are not angrily responding on Twitter to the hilarious #FoxNewsFacts hashtag

Yes, we’ve all been having a good laugh at Fox News’ expense for hosting a “terrorism expert” saying that everybody in Birmingham is a Muslim and the entire city is a no-go area .

Especially on Twitter, where the #FoxNewsFacts hashtag has been a brilliantly British response to the ludicrous statement.

And then suddenly it looked like Fox News had got rather upset about the hashtag, and started responding from @FoxNewsPress .

Except, not really.

At the time of writing, the account has only made 25 tweets. And it appears it was set up in the middle of last night. Here’s their first ever tweet...

We can’t quite imagine a Fox News board meeting in the wee hours with someone shouting “Quick! The Brits are laughing at us with a hashtag! Activate a brand new Twitter account for our press team.”

Or approving of a Twitter account threatening individual users with legal action for making jokes.

So, until we hear otherwise, we are calling this one a hoax.

Still, we’ll always have #FoxNewsFacts as the funniest hashtag of the year to date to cheer us up.
