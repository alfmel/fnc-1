The woman was rushed to hospital where doctors told her she was pregnant

A nun living in an Italian convent has given birth to a surprise baby after complaining of stomach pains, according to the Italian press.

The nun, who came to Italy from South America, belonged to an order called the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ in Macerata, located in the Italian region of Le Marche.

She says she had no idea she was pregnant.

She was taken to hospital by her sisters, where doctors quickly told her she was pregnant, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere Adriatico.

The baby is healthy and the nun’s convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him.

The nun arrived at the convent in June, when it is now believed she was already pregnant.

According to the Italian newspaper L’Unione Sarda, the convent said the woman "is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping” possibly because she had not yet taken her vows.

The woman, who is reported to be from Bolivia, has now been discharged from hospital.
