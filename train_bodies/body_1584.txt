Banksy appears to have shared a message of sorrow and hope Wednesday after an attack on the Paris office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo left 12 people dead.

The drawing was shared from an Instagram account and Facebook page that many believe are associated with the enigmatic street artist. Both posts carried only the message "RIP".

That said, there is debate about the authenticity of the image. The page the drawing was shared from was initially verified by Facebook, but that verification was later removed. Banksy's publicist Jo Brooks told Animal New York that the page is "100 per cent fake" and the artist's website says Banksy is "not on Facebook and has never used Twitter."

Many have speculated, however, that the denials are all part of cultivating Banksy's puzzling persona.

The Guardian and Mashable both identified the Instagram post as being authentic, but Mashable later updated its story to reflect doubts about the image's authenticity. In 2013 The New York Times identified a different Instagram account as being linked to the artist.

Regardless of whether the real Banksy is behind the drawing, there's no denying it's a powerful image.
