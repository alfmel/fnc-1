Jaipur: A man who was allegedly caught red-handed trying to rape a teenage girl in Rajasthan is in a critical condition in hospital after locals chopped off his genitals with a meat cleaver.

The incident took place in Ganganagar district in Rajasthan.

Locals got alerted by the girl's screams for help and found 40-year-old Suresh Kumar pinning the girl against a wall. The mob dragged him to a nearby butchersâ€™ shop where he was beaten up with sticks for an hour before castrating him, as reported on Friday.

The report said, the locals then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and left a bloodied Kumar nearby.

The Daily Mail quoted an eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan saying that no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'

"We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished," Dhawan said.

Police said people can't take the law into their "own hands" and they are looking for the attackers.

"As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them," an officer said.

The victim was treated for shock, and given counselling.
