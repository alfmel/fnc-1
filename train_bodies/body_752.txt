The Apple Watch may be coming to your local Apple Store sooner than you think. According to 9to5Mac, the highly anticipated wearable could arrive in the United States by the end of March.

The company is planning on familiarizing its Apple Store employees with the wearable product through training programs held in Cupertino, California, and Austin, Texas, in sessions scheduled for Feb. 9 through Feb. 16. The employees who attend this conference will then train employees at their local stores.

Apple declined to comment to CNBC Tuesday evening.

Since its introduction in September, the Apple Watch has gone through extensive testing. In particular, Apple is refining the product's battery and charging mechanism, according to the report.

There are three tiers slated for the Apple Watch: standard, Sport, and Edition. Thus far, the company has revealed that the glass and metal Sport model will cost consumers $349. However, rumors indicated that the stainless steel and sapphire crystal watch will likely be priced at $500 and the gold device will be sold for more than $1,000.
