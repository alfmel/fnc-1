What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 
The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown."
Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson.
