Zack Snyder recently unveiled an official photo of the Batmobile from "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice." But immediately after came word that one of the Batmobiles has been stolen. Nobody was surprised since production is going on in Detroit, a city with the highest crime rate.

Warner Bros never confirmed the report and its still unclear whether the vehicle was ever stolen. But Snyder just took to Twitter to make light of the situation, posting a photo of the Gotham City police recovering the Batmobile and arresting the individual responsible. "Case closed," he wrote.

Meanwhile, we also have a video of the Batmobile being taken out for a spin. This is one of many videos out there. Some others show a second car with a camera on the roof recording the Batmobile in motion. Check everything out below.
