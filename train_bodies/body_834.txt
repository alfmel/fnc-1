Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter confirms to the Daily News that the rumored Condé Nast rat infestation is actually happening and yes, it's disgusting. "They're rats! What do you think?" Carter told the Daily News when asked if that rats were as gross as previously reported.

And the rodent problem is only getting worse, since the rats spread from Vogue office throughout Condé Nast. According to the Daily News, Condé employees aren't allowed to eat at their desks and the city health department might get involved. Anna Wintour doesn't even want to go inside in the building at all now, much less her office.
