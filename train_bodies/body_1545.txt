Macaulay Culkin has once again died — at least, according to a death hoax spreading online.

The troubled actor, who at one point was reportedly entrenched in heroin addiction that friends feared he had only months to live, is once again the subject of a hoax claiming that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment.

News that Macaulay Culkin had allegedly died spread quickly on Facebook and Twitter, with users linking to a story on something called MSNBC.website.com (which is entirely separate from the real MSNBC). The report read:

Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

“The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,” said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

It has been only a few months since the last hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead. The actor was also reported dead back in April, with Facebook users mourning his alleged death and even a memorial page popping up.

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (April 20, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away,” the report claimed. “Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”

Though reps for the actor denied the April reports, they have not yet spoken out on the latest hoax claiming that Macaulay Culkin is dead.
