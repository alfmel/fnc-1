No craving can be more important than your health as the North Korean leader finds it out the hard way. Kim Jong-un broke his ankle after he had put on extra weight from regularly consuming imported cheese, said a report on Tuesday.

And the reason for his mysterious disappearance has been finally put to rest when his condition was revealed. He was put to bed after a surgery to fix his fractured ankles.

Uncontrolled daily eating of Emmental, imported from Switzerland, is believed to be responsible for his rapid weight gain, the metro.co.uk reported.

The report citing a South Korean daily said that the tyrant is recovering from the fractured ankles after the strain of his expanding waistline put pressure on a pre-existing injury - and caused the bones to crack.

"I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended," the South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo quoted a source as saying.

The source added that the 31-year-old had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

He has not been seen in public for almost a month. The gossip mill over his alleged disappearance went into overdrive after he missed a session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang for the first time since ascending to power in 2011.
