NAIROBI: The death of the leader of Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab rebels in a US air strike is a "very strong probability," but still unconfirmed, security sources said today.

"There is a very strong probability that he is dead.... This requires verification on the ground, which is not simple," said a Western security source, who asked not be identified.
