Digital retail company Amazon announced Thursday it plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for holiday shopping season.

The company's first physical location will function as more of a warehouse than a big-box store. The location will have a limited supply of items available for same-day delivery in the city, and will process returns, exchanges, and pickup orders, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon did not immediately say how long the experimental store would remain open, nor whether it was preparing to open similar physical locations elsewhere in the country.
