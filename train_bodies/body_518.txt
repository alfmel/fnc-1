CBI files case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh over forced castration IANS
The agency filed case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief on Wednesday on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Hansraj Chauhan, a former Dera follower, had filed a petition in the high court in 2012 alleging that he along with around 400 male devotees of the Dera were castrated inside the ashram on the orders of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
Disposing off the petition, the high court had ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case in December 2014. The court asked the CBI to file the first status report by 2 March.
Chauhan had demanded a CBI inquiry and compensation for the castration inside the ashram in 2000. Chauhan claimed that the castration of Dera followers was done by the chief through doctors employed in his hospital.
Chauhan said in his petition that he along with other devotees was castrated under false claims that they would be able to realise god through the Dera chief after their castration.
Haryana Police handed over the documents related to the incident to the CBI on 2 January. Haryana Police also provided documents related to seven other devotees of the Dera chief who also claimed to be castrated.
 

The Dera has dismissed the castration allegation. Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is making his film debut with "MSG: The Messenger of God", is also facing trial in connection with cases of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples.
