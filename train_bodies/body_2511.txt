The weather man was reporting from Sugar Mountain N.C. Saturday night when anchor Lester Holt said he was going to give a live report. But Seidel’s back was facing the camera and it appeared to many viewers he was answering Mother Nature’s call instead of reporting on it. But the network said he had dropped his phone in the snow and was looking for it.

The TV news weather forecast appeared to call for yellow snow — but the network says it was not so.

NBC weatherman Mike Seidel missed a live report from snow-blanketed North Carolina on Saturday night because his back was to the camera. And the way he turned around while also on camera — appearing to zip up the fly of his pants before putting his gloves back on — suggested to viewers that he had been relieving himself.

During the telecast anchor Lester Holt said hello to the No. 1 Weather Channel meteorologist who was in Sugar Mountain, but his back was turned to the camera.

Seidel's body was slightly hunched over and he was looking downward near some trees.

After a few pauses Seidel can be heard asking "Why?" as he starts to turn around. The weather man is holding his gloves in his hands despite the cold temperature.

As he turns he slightly moves his arm, which may have been an attempt to close an open zipper. He then hurriedly puts his gloves back on.

A network official told the Daily News that Seidel had dropped his cell phone in the snow and had turned around to find it.

Seidel has tweeted pictures of the snowstorm on his Twitter account, but did not make any mention of the incident.
