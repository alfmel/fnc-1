A mushroom with hallucinogenic properties has been found growing at Buckingham Palace but no one suspects Queen Elizabeth of cultivating the magic mushroom.

The Amanita muscaria was found growing wild in the extensive palace gardens during preparations for a television show.

The mushroom's hallucinogenic properties have long been known and it has commonly been used in rituals.

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of naturally occurring Amanita muscaria.

The mushroom can be beneficial to trees but can be poisonous to humans.

Officials say mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens.
