Vermin? They're totally in Vogue. 

According to staffers who work at the storied fashion bible, helmed by Anna Wintour, the brand-new Vogue offices at the Freedom Tower in downtown New York City are full of furry little friends – and no one thinks it's chic at all. 

"It's true," an insider confirms to PEOPLE. "The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It's nasty." 

According to a report on Gawker, Wintour, who recently made headlines for calling the magazine's April cover stars Kim Kardashian and Kanye West not "deeply tasteful," is apparently refusing to enter her personal office unless it's rat-free. 

However, beyond the rodent problem, insiders say another issue the fashionistas are having is with the office's location itself – next to the former World Trade Center towers. 

"It's weird down there. You're always reminded of 9/11," a source says. Another adds, "It just has creepy vibes."
