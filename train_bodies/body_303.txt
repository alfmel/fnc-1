ports of Judd Nelson’s death have been greatly exaggerated. 
 
Despite rumors that swept the Internet on Sunday morning, the “Breakfast Club” star is alive and well, his manager and agent told the Los Angeles Times. 
 
Agent Gregg Klein even hustled to Nelson’s home Sunday morning -- which he said is not in the building mentioned in the original false report -- to take a photo of the actor with the front page of today's newspaper.

Klein was to the point when he answered The Times' query about Nelson's status: "Reports of Judd Nelson's death are not accurate please see attached photo."
