Editors are said to be "petrified" of rats spotted under - and on top of desks at the fashion magazine's new offices

Last time we checked, rats weren't chic - so why they're hanging around Vogue's new NYC offices is anyone's guess.

Publishing house Condé Nast have just moved into a new home at 1 WTC - the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere - and there's a nasty problem occurring, according to Page Six.

The reported rodent situation - which was first reported by People back in November - isn't going away. But according to Page Six, Vogue boss Anna Wintour is determined to ignore it.

A source told Page Six that editors noticed a rat on the loose in the office - so they informed their notoriously frosty fashion boss, as you would.

"They were petrified, and told Anna, 'We found rats under our desk,'" an insider told Page Six. One said, 'There’s a rat on top of my desk.'"

But Wintour allegedly told the staff: "I don’t want to hear about it."

A different source also told Page Six that the rat problem is ongoing.

However, another Vogue source denies that there's a rodent presence in the Vogue offices, telling Page Six: "That conversation never happened."

Back in November a source told People: "The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It's nasty."

Well, Maybe Anna Wintour just really loves cheese, or something.
