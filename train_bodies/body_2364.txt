The US is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed the leader of the Al Shabaab terrorist group.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said drones and manned aircraft bombed a gathering of Al Shabaab commanders in a camp in south-central Somalia on Monday.

"US special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions," he said.

Mr Kirby confirmed that the attack was aimed at leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, also referred to as Abu-Zubayr, and that the bombs definitely hit the meeting of Shabaab chiefs.

But he said it was unclear if Godane had been killed in the raid.

"We are still assessing the results of the operation, and we'll provide additional information when and if appropriate," he said.

The assault did not involve US ground troops, Mr Kirby added.

He declined to provide details of the special operations forces' unit that took part in the air raid or the nature of the intelligence that led to the strike.

The militant group is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, regularly launching attacks against state targets and in neighbouring countries that contribute to the African Union force.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled Al Shabaab as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The US State Department has listed Godane as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives and, if confirmed, his death would mark a serious setback for Al Shabaab forces.

The bombing raid reflected a commitment by Washington and its allies "to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as ... threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world," Mr Kirby said.
