Sources say Sony is beginning negotiations with The Fighter actor, who was originally eyed to play the late Apple Computer co-founder back when David Fincher was in talks to direct. The move comes after Bale's negotiations with Fox to star in The Deep Blue Goodbye hit a roadblock. Sources say Fox was trying to include sequel options for Bale to tackle the lead role of Detective Travis McGee in what is hoped to be a franchise starter, but the actor balked. Now, talks are ongoing with Bale without sequel options, but even if a deal is reached, the actor would shoot the Jobs project before Deep Blue Goodbye.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled Jobs film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin and is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years. Sony optioned the best-seller in 2011, around the time of Jobs' death.
