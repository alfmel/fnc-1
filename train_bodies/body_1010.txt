Islamic State (ISIS) militants claim to have captured a supply bundle dropped by U.S. forces near the northern Syrian town of Kobani. Video posted to a YouTube channel associated with ISIS shows them rifling through packages containing dozens of grenades.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town. However, Kirby said that at least one supply package may have fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

"We are aware that one bundle was destroyed [via a video]," said Kirby. "Analysts are working as fast as they can to validate it."

U.S. forces airdropped a total of 27 bundles containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies early Monday. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities.

Kobani, located just yards from the Turkish border, has been the scene of an intense battle between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants, who attacked the area in late September.
