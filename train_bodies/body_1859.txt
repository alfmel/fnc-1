Axl Rose, the singer of Guns N’ Roses, has not died in West Hollywood at the age of 52.

A hoax news website designed to look like MSNBC was promulgating the false rumors this week. The site says MSNBC.website, which isn’t real.

Users on social media were questioning whether the “Chinese Democracy” singer was still alive.

The bogus story reads: “Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.”

It also includes fake quotes from police officers. The article has been shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook.

MSNBC.website was also responsible for a hoax that said Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin was found dead at age 34 a few weeks ago. That obviously wasn’t true, either.

Earlier his year, Rose said that Guns N’ Roses has two new albums in the works. The last album the band released was “Chinese Democracy” in November 2008, which was censored in China due to its title track and reference to Falun Gong, a traditional Chinese spiritual practice that has been persecuted in China for the past 15 years.

“We recorded a lot of things before ‘Chinese’ was out,” Rose told Rolling Stone.

He added: “We’ve worked more on some of those things and we’ve written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of Chinese. That’s already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from Chinese. That’s been done for a while, too. But after Vegas [Guns N’ Roses is performing a residency at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino that runs through June 7], we’re going to start looking very seriously at what we’re doing in that regard.”
