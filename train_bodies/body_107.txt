Never fear, Banksy fans: the infamous street-artist has not been unmasked, despite frenzied reports on American websites.

Online news sites were subject to a hoax on Friday from US ‘media troll extaordinaire’ Paul Horner.

Sites Complex, Death and Taxes, and Jezebel published online stories stating that Paul Horner, 39, had been identified as the street-artist known as Banksy, and had been arrested by British police in Watford.

Horner is in fact editor of the cunningly-named Super Official News website, where he makes statements such as: “Until then just remember, if it’s on the internet it must be true”, and that “Paul Horner is an American hero.”

Website NationalReport said that “London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards” had held a press conference unmasking Banksy after the arrest - but according to the Met, no such officer exists. However, there is a dairy farmer called Lyndon Edwards.

Other Banksy pretenders incude,‘cap man’ in New York, 2013; Robin Gunningham in Bristol, 2008; Mr Brainwash in 2010; and Rose Biggin, an 89-year-old from Camden, North London, who was touted as the elusive street-artist. The pensioner said of her “I’m Spartacus” moment: “It sure does help to pass the time.”

Even a Battersea charity shop got in on the act – earlier in October someone from the Fara shop on Northcote Road not pretending to be the artist painted a Banksy-style mural and tweeted it soon after.
