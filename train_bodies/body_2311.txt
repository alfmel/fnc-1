Apple is reportedly aiming to sell upwards of 50 million Apple Watches in 2015.

The news comes via a new report from Digitimes, which claims that Apple has placed orders for shipments of up to five million AMOLED panels per month throughout the year. These screens will be used as the innovative touch-sensitive display for Apple’s wearables debut.

The panels are being sourced exclusively from LG, which is already a supplier for many Apple LCD panels, although it has not previously supplied the company with AMOLEDs.

The projected sales are on the top end of those suggested by Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, who previously said that the iWatch could achieve sales in the region of 30-60 million units in its first year on the market, thanks to the “halo effect” of brand loyalty to Apple that will drive sales of the product.

If Apple can sell 50 million+ Apple Watch devices that will make it the fastest selling new iOS device in history. The iPad, by comparison, sold 19.5 million units in its first year, while the iPhone moved a relatively paltry 5.4 million units.

The Apple Watch is set to arrive Q1 next year, with prices starting at $349.
