THERE are unconfirmed reports that jihadists fighting for the Islamic State have contracted Ebola.

Local media outlets reported that cases of Ebola have showed up at a hospital in the IS-controlled city of Mosul, in Iraq, Mashable reported.

Iraq’s official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, claimed that the disease had arrived in Mosul from jihadists “from several countries” including Africa.

An official told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus. Although the symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, can easily be mistaken for many other illnesses such as malaria.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been unable to confirm the cases.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications told Mashable they were in the process of reaching out to government officials in Iraq to see if help was needed investigating the cases.

IS counts fighters from a number of African countries among its ranks though few, if any, are known to have come from areas hit by Ebola.
