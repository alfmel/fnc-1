School field trips aren’t what they used to be.

Just ask the furious parents of seven teenage girls who became pregnant on a five-day school trip to Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia.

According to InSerbia News, 28 girls between the ages of 13 and 15 made the trip from their hometown of Banja Luka.

Nenad Babici, national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, said it was discovered the seven schoolgirls all became pregnant during the excursion.

The itinerary was to visit museums and historic sights in Sarajevo, ranked among the finest in the world.

The Daily Mail reports parents are livid, demanding an explanation regarding teacher supervision of the girls.

But Babici is actually blaming parents for failing to educate their children properly. He noted early sexual activity can lead to unwanted consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, told InSerbia a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he said.

He explained educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that [the] street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”
