LONDON â€” The Islamic State militant known as "Jihadi John," who has been seen in videos of hostages being beheaded, has been named as Mohammed Emwazi by the BBC and The Washington Post.

The BBC said Emwazi, believed to be a Kuwaiti-born British man from west London, was known to British security services, who chose not to disclose his name for operational reasons.

Jihadi John has appeared in videos showing the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, U.S. medic Abdul-Rahman Kassig and Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

The black-clad, masked militant also appeared in a video last month with Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed.

The Washington Post said Emwazi, who comes from a well-to-do family, graduated from college with a degree in computer programming.

He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012, before joining the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, the paper reported.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group CAGE, which was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria, told the Washington Post he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John.

"There was an extremely strong resemblance," he said. "This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person."

In a statement Commander Richard Walton, of Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command, said: "We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

"We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation."

In September, FBI Director James Comey said U.S. officials believed they know the identify of Jihadi John, but did not release his name or nationality.
