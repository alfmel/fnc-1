Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”
