Lucita Sandoval was not involved in a sex tape scandal after a newspaper unearthed the truth following internet gossip sites that were filled with reports of the story

A graphic sex video that has been shared across South America after rumours emerged that it involved a female teacher and her teenage pupil has been exposed as a fake.

The footage was shared by thousands of people in Argentina after false reports came out that it showed a woman called Lucita Sandoval from the city of Santiago del Estero with a 16-year-old boy.

Internet gossip sites incorrectly stated that Miss Sandoval was a teacher and was secretly filmed by a grinning pupil of hers.

It has since emerged that the woman in the video is not Miss Sandoval, but a completely different woman from the city of Corrientes in Argentina.

And reports that she engaged in sexual antics with a school pupil proved to be false too, after it was revealed the young man in the video is a college student.

It was also falsely reported that the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils

An Argentinian newspaper investigated the claims, and found that no such woman exists and the video appears to be a private sex tape that was shared via Whatsapp and then uploaded to a hardcore porn website.
