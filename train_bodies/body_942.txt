Ok, this is all still rumor, but there’s a chance a Batmobile was stolen from the set of Batman v Superman set in Detroit. My former employer Bleeding Cool posted this:
The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.

It would not be the first time a Batmobile has been nicked in Detroit. Though that was just a $200 replica of the TV Series version back in 2o10.

So far we have no clue or confirmation, but if this is true, we should quickly form a list of suspects. My money is on King Tut.

Stay tuned for updates, rumors, or the dispelling of rumors!
