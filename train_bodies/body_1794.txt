Former “NBC Nightly News” anchor Tom Brokaw wants his replacement Brian Williams fired, the New York Post’s Page Six reported Thursday night, citing sources.

“Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,” an NBC source told Page Six. “He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.”

Williams, on Wednesday, recanted a 2003 war story in which he claimed that he was aboard a helicopter in Iraq that was forced down because of RPG fire. The story, which had been repeated throughout the years, had been recently challenged on social media.

An NBC source told Page Six that Brokaw and former NBC News president Steve Capus “knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it.”

Nevertheless, a network source told the newspaper that the network is firmly behind Williams.

“He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,” a network source told Page Six.
