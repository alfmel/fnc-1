From Staff Reports
An Internet posting claiming a family of five in Purdon has come down with Ebola is not true.
The website, which has the appearance of a news site, is reporting a the town of Purdon has been sealed off by the CDC and local police. This is not true.
Local Emergency Management officials, the Corsicana/Navarro County Health Department and Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner all report there is no truth to the claim on the website.
Navarro County officials issued the following news release calling the report untrue:
"A release today on at least one website, National Report, stated that “The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus.”
 "This report is entirely false."
"Local authorities, emergency management, and county government have been inundated with calls concerning this false report. Please be assured if this were accurate information, you would have been notified immediately from accurate sources first."
 "Please ensure that you utilize accurate information sources when looking on social media and any unknown news sources."

Several questions have been posted on the Daily Sun Facebook page asking about the site — a site that also boasts stories that claim Las Vegas oddsmakers are setting odds on school shootings, and a claim the Obama administration is planning to conduct a sale of all marijuana seized during the Obama administration.
In addition to the source of the first posting, sites that commonly aggregate content from other sites and re-publish it are spreading the rumors to a wider audience.
