This extraordinary video shows the moment a US Marine is shot in the head by a Taliban sniper in Afghanistan - and lives to tell the tale.

The three minute, 12 second clip, filmed from a helmet camera, follows three of the US Navy's elite amphibious infantrymen as they take part in a joint helicopter raid in Now Zad, Helmand Province in 2013.

After hearing insurgent gunfire, the trio go to investigate, pausing for cover in the exit of a tunnel.

It is at this moment that the marksman strikes, a bullet from his high-powered weapon ricocheting off the helmet of the second Marine in the patrol with a loud crack.

After some choice language, the men beat a hasty retreat, warning colleagues that a sharpshooter has them in his sights.

Lucky escape: The Marine's ears are left ringing by the Taliban sniper's bullet

Once they are back under cover, the Marine with the helmet camera says to his lucky colleague: "Dude, you got shot.

"I saw it hit your Kevlar.

"You lucky son of a b***h."
