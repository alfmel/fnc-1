The Apple Watch Sport may start at a mere $349, but the product line’s price point could well soar from there!

According to Daring Fireball‘s John Gruber, Apple’s 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition may sell for as much as $4,999.

“Most people think I’m joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000,” Gruber writes in a new blog post. “I couldn’t be more serious.”

Gruber notes that the device might cost $1,999 at a bare minimum, but this is unlikely since the components alone would cost more than this.

While $4,999 would give the Apple Watch Edition the dubious distinction of being both one of the company’s most expensive products and its smallest, Gruber points out that the device will not just be gold-plated, but actually manufactured using 18-karat gold.

With that said, is anyone going to want to regularly upgrade a solid gold watch that costs them the same as a Swiss watch which could conceivably stay in a person’s family for a lifetime?

For the record, Gruber thinks the stainless steel/sapphire Apple Watch will set customers back $999.

Guess we’ll find out for sure in early 2015, when the Apple Watch finally ships.

Hey, at least the gold Apple Watch Edition comes with a snazzy charging case.
