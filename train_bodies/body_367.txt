Social media is awash with news of Islamic State using chemical weapons in an Eastern neighbourhood of Kobane.

Asya Abdullah, co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), who is in Kobane told Kurdish Question that a gas attack had taken place in an Eastern neighbourhood of the city tonight (21 Oct). Abdullah said that they didn't know where the gas had come from because there hadn' t been any explosions.

She said: "It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighbourhood beforehand. Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment to do tests."

Dr. Welat, one of four doctors in Kobane told Guney Yildiz, a journalist at BBC World that he suspected the chemical attack was either chlorine gas or phosphorous shells. Dr Welat said: "We can't confirm a chemical attack without proper tests and ask that medical equipment be airdropped for this."

This is the second incident to have occurred where Islamic State may have used chemical weapons in Kobane.
