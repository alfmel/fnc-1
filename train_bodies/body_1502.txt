If Bali belly, dengue fever and dangerous drinks have not been enough to put you off taking a holiday to Bali - perhaps the story of "spiderman" will. 
West Australian man Dylan Thomas may now be joking about whether he'll develop "superpowers" but on the weekend he was experiencing a "searing sensation" as a spider that had made its way into his abdomen through an old appendix scar, crawled underneath his skin, all the way up to his sternum.
The horrifying incident happened while the Bunbury man, now known as 'spiderman' to his friends, was holidaying on the Indonesian island.

"It wasn't really a tickling sensation, obviously once the venom started to affect my skin it was a really burning sensation like a searing feeling," he said. 
Mr Thomas said he believed the spider had burrowed into his abdomen on Friday night as he noticed a mark on his stomach on Saturday morning that continued to worsen.

An initial visit to a doctor on Sunday saw him diagnosed as having been bitten by an insect and sent away with antihistamines.
Mr Thomas spent another day with the arachnid tunneling inside of him, before going to a hospital.
"Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily," he told his Facebook friends. 
Two doctors who initially assessed him "had no idea" what was causing the marks on Mr Thomas's skin until they called in a specialist dermatologist.
The spider was eventually removed with tweezers. It was dead when pulled out.
Mr Thomas said the experience had ruined his first trip to Bali.
