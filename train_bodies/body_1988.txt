American photojournalist Luke Somers, held by al-Qaeda militants following his abduction in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September last year, was killed during a failed rescue attempt early Saturday, according to his sister.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI. "We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace," she said. Lucy Somers gave the comments to the Associated Press.

The claim nonetheless seemed to contradict a statement on the Yemen defense ministry's website carried by Reuters that suggested Luke Somers had been freed following a suspected U.S. drone strike Saturday in Yemen that killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, according to an official who spoke to the AP. The official did not elaborate and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.

There was also no immediate comment from U.S. officials, who rarely discuss their drone campaign in Yemen.

Following the strike, the Al Arabiya news organization tweeted that "reports suggest U.S. #journalists held in #Yemen freed," but there was no immediate confirmation of that report or the originating source.

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, says is certain his "life is in danger."

The video features an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers — dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head — at the end. He notes that he was born in England but has American citizenship and lived in America for most of his life.

Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Thursday that during a U.S. raid last month that attempted to free Somers he turned out not to be at the site.
