An alleged attempted rapist in India received a grisly punishment for his alleged attack on a young teenager – an angry mob dragged him into a butcher’s shop where his penis was severed with a meat cleaver.

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

Kumar is still in a critical condition after the attack.

Local man Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ‘No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.’

‘We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

‘This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.’

.A police spokesman said: ‘People cannot take the law into your own hands.

‘As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.

The girl was treated for shock.
