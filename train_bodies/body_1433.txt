Nikolai Kryaglyachenko has suddenly started developiong the same powers of metallic attraction as X-Men villain, Magneto – and it was all because of an electri shock that nearly killed him.

The 12-year-old had been walking home after school when he leaned briefly against the lamp post that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

And the next day he discovered that metal objects stuck to him like glue.

He revealed: "When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened.

"When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

"Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest."

The comic book fan naturally assumed he was turning into a reallife Magneto and decided to test out his new abilities.

He explained: "I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.
