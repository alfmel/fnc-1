London, Nov 24 : Kim Jong-un has been guzzling litres of rare snake wine to perk up his love life with wife, it has been reported. The cases of the pricey plonk with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle were delivered at the supreme leader’s palace in North Korea, the Daily Star reported. Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improve the size of their manhood.

The 31-year-old despot, and his wife Ri Jol-su, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight. The ruler’s waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky. Sources revealed that the elite in the country joke that Jong-un is now too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.

Earlier he was missing altogether from the scene and his puzzling absence created a lot of curiosity. Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance for more than a month, with state media today reporting a visit to a new housing complex in Pyongyang. It marked the first time Kim has been seen since September 3 – an extended absence that fueled intense speculation, including rumours of a serious illness or even a coup.

The North’s official KCNA news agency said Kim made a “field guidance” tour of the new residential complex specially built for scientists working on North Korea’s satellite programme. ”Looking over the exterior of the apartment houses and public buildings, decorated with diverse colored tiles, (Kim) expressed great satisfaction, saying they looked very beautiful,” the agency said.
