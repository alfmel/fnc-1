Thousands of social media users are distributing an unverified photo which claims to show the body of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he was purportedly killed by US airstrikes after three senior members of ISIS, including an aide to al-Baghdadi were also killed by US air strikes. 
Talking to NBC News, a senior Iraqi official confirmed the deaths on Thursday. The strike on the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed Abu Hajar al-Sufi, an aide to al-Baghdadi, as well as an explosives operative and the military leader of nearby Tal Afar, the source said. Al Arabiya cited the Iraqi Defence Ministry as saying that Baghdadi’s aide had been killed.
Pentagon Spokesman Col Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed”. The US has been carrying out airstrikes across north Iraq after the brutal terrorists of ISIS gained ground in a murderous sweep in June.
A number of news outlets and websites have published the unverified photo and news about the death of al-Baghdadi by US airstrikes.
