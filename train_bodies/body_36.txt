The London Metropolitan Police has denied reports that street artist Banksy has been arrested on Monday after a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force operation.
A Met spokesperson said the force did not have any information of such arrest and even if they had, it was possible they would not publish a press release about it.
Meanwhile, the fake press release initially published by PR Log has been taken down.
