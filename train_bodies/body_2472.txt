While it’s not clear exactly how waterproof the Apple Watch is, people who prefer to take their timepieces with them in the shower may have a new reason to be excited about the arrival of Apple’s new smartwatch.

Tim Cook told an Apple Store employee in Germany that he wears his Apple Watch with him in the shower, without any problem, according to a report from French site iGen. Considering how busy Cook is, his watch habit makes sense to stay on top of the time and any important notifications.

The Watch’s ability to survive in water isn’t surprising, since it’s designed as a workout accessory in addition to something people wear around town. The device has to be at least somewhat resistant to human sweat, and in protecting it against that kind of moisture, it makes sense that Apple’s engineers would make it showerproof as well.

Apple hasn’t claimed that it’s fully waterproof, which may make it less appealing to swimmers, divers and other people who want their timepieces to survive an extended dip in the water. There’s also the matter of the Watch’s battery life: Cook said that he has to take it off every night to charge.

It won’t be long until consumers will be able to try out all of that for themselves. Cook revealed last month that the watch will be available for sale in April.
