The next MacBook Air will sport a twelve-inch screen, a thinner and smaller physical footprint, a cleaner chassis with one combined power connector and USB port, faster Broadwell chipsets from Intel, and it might even come in Space Grey. That’s the theory from Marc Gurman, and there’s no immediate reason to discount it.

Gurman and the 9to5Mac team have pulled together all the information, leaks, rumors, and speculation around a new Apple laptop, thrown in a dash of extrapolation, and put together a comprehensive prediction and artists impression of the new MacBook Air that should be available during the summer of 2015.

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.

This new MacBook Air will sport a twelve-inch screen, be physically smaller than the thirteen-inch MacBook Air, and could be narrower than the current svelte eleven inch MacBook Air. This will be accomplished by reducing the bezels around the screen and the keyboard, reducing the size and pitch of the keys, and repositioning the speakers.

9to5Mac also believe that Apple will ditch many of the ports and connectors around the chassis, leaving this MacBook Air with a headphone socket, a dual-pinhole microphone set-up, and a single USB-C port for power and cabled connectivity.
