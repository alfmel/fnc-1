YouTuber Josh Paler Lin – better-known for his hilarious pranks – was feeling the holiday spirit and decided to give a homeless man in California $100 to see what he would do with it. 

He followed the man, Thomas, with a camera to see how he spent the money. His first stop was a liquor store, but not for the reasons some might think: He bought bread and then headed over to a park, where Lin filmed him distributing the food to other homeless people. 

When Lin approached him at the park, Thomas explained his story. He quit his job to take care of his sick parents, only to lose his home after his parents died within two weeks of each other. He's been on the streets for four months. 

"I feel I owe you an apology," Lin told Thomas after hearing his story. 




Thomas explained that he simply wanted to use the money to help others in his situation. Lin gave him another $100 and has even started a crowdfunding campaign to help buy Thomas clothes, food and get him on the road to a job. He's already surpassed his $10,00 goal and raised over $60,000. 

"There are things money can't buy and I get happiness out of what I'm doing," Thomas told Lin. 

"And I honestly truly understand what he meant right after because as I've helped him I feel so happy," Lin told TODAY.
