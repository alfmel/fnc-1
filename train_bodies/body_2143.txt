Death Hoax

In a report published by Unam Noticias, we read that Millan died in a Santa Clarita hospital of a heart attack. The story states that Millan’s death was announced by his wife at a press conference. The article, as of this writing, has received nearly 20,000 shares online.

The report, however, is not true.

Some shocked readers shared the sad news on social media, without first verifying the claims in the report. Although as of this writing, neither Millan nor his representatives have responded to the death hoax, there are several factors which indicate the article is not true.

Consider:

The original report does not cite any sources.
No legitimate media outlets have reported Millan’s death
There is no evidence that Millan’s wife held a press conference
There has been no such announcement on Millan’s official Facebook page.
The story on Unam Noticias is rife with grammatical and spelling errors (example: “Millan was hospitalize yesterday afternoon, the medical reports indicate that he suffered a fulminate heart attack, which paralyze his heart unavailable for the blood…”
Bottom Line

The report claiming that Cesar Millan died of a heart attack appears to be yet another celebrity death hoax. The poorly-written source of this report offered no sources and has received no corroboration from trusted media outlets or representatives of Millan.
