BREAKING NEWS: Sources are reporting that Judd Nelson, best known for his roles as John Bender in The Breakfast Club, has been found dead at age 55.

Multiple unconfirmed reports say Nelson was found dead Saturday evening in his Los Angeles condo, Sierra Towers after police responded to a 911 call for an unconscious man around 9:25 p.m.

Although police have not yet released the man's identity, multiple occupants of the 31-story West Hollywood high-rise have confirmed that it was Nelson's condo police responded to and a single body was carried out of the apartment on a stretcher.

The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner will determine the cause of death as investigators try to rule out foul play.

Nelson began acting in the mid-1980s, starring in many films but it was his roles in John Hughes's The Breakfast Club and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire that made Nelson a star. A subsequent article in New York magazine, which focused primarily on the success of these films, resulted in the term "Brat Pack" being coined.

In 1986 Nelson provided the voice of Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime in The Transformers: The Movie and was signed on to voice Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime again in the live action movie Transformers 5.
