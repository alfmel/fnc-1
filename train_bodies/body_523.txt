In a mass influx of basicness, it seems Durex may or may not be hopping on the pumpkin spice bandwagon.

This past weekend, images of a Starbucks PSL-inspired condom took social media by storm.

Is this a ploy to get basic bitches of the world to stop procreating? Will they actually be able to convince a potential partner to wrap it up with something as bizarre as this? Is there even a demand for a product like this?

The image is an altered image of Durex’s flavored “Taste Me” condom line, which just begs me to ask one question: Can your genitals taste flavors?

Oh, wait… That’s not what they were getting at, is it?

There have been no official corporate announcements determining if this will be a reality or not. But, after seeing this image spread, why wouldn’t Durex look into this?

If there’s anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the PSL trend, right?

Sounds like an easy moneymaker to me, even if it’s just a novelty.
