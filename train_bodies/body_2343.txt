Oscar-winner Christian Bale, who has played Batman and Moses, is about to take on another iconic figure: Steve Jobs.

Sources confirm the actor is in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.

Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

“The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.”

“It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”

Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Bale, who can next be seen in Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” is still negotiating for the Travis McGee pic “The Deep Blue Goodbye” at Fox. Sources tell Variety talks have taken longer then expected because Bale was not interested in doing a sequel to “Deep Blue” while Fox wanted one.

Insiders say Bale would likely shoot “Jobs” in the spring and follow it up with ‘The Deep Blue Goodbye.”

He is repped by WME.
