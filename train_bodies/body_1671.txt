This news shouldn't bring me so much joy, but Bleeding Cool rumormonger Rich Johnston is reporting that the Batmobile, or at least one of the Batmobiles used for filming Superman v. Batman: Paths of Glory, has been stolen. The movie is being filmed in Detroit, which hasn't been going through the best times of late. There's no official confirmation yet, but hey, maybe somebody needed it to drive out of town to get some fucking water.

Hey, their tax dollars paid for the breaks Warner Bros. gets for shooting in the state anyway, so when you look at it that way, the thieves were just taking back what was rightfully theirs!

But don't worry! The Outhouse has it on good authority that the theft wasn't at all malicious. It was just some people trying to win the prize in MTV's Steal the Batmobile contest from 1989!
