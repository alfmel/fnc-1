LAS VEGAS -- A neighbor tells 8 News NOW former baseball star Jose Canseco was hurt in an accidental shooting Tuesday afternoon at his house on the eastside of the Las Vegas valley.

Metro Police confirm there was an accidental shooting at the address, but would not confirm the former player was hurt. However, records show Canseco owns the home where the shooting happened.

Canseco was a hitting star in the 80s, making a name for himself on the Oakland A's, and later admitting he used performance-enhancing drugs during much of his career.
