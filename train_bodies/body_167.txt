LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

David Carr, the New York Times media columnist, wrote last month on Twitter, weeks before his death at 58, “No brainer quiz. What media co exec did I watch win $100k at blackjack last nite? Hint: gambling not his only vice.”
