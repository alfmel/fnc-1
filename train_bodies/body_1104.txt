Spotting a spider on the floor may give you a fright, but imagine finding out one was living under your skin for three days.

This is what happened to Australian man Dylan Thomas who went on vacation to Bali with a friend. His friend noticed a strange red scar going up the 21-year-old's stomach. At first, doctors told him it was an insect bite, but they later discovered a spider had burrowed itself into Thomas's abdomen, most likely through his recent appendix scar.

Thomas posted this on his Facebook page: "Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last three days, managed to get it out luckily. Haven't felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it's all over."

Thomas explains not only was there a painful burning sensation under his skin, but the scar began to get bigger and bubble.
