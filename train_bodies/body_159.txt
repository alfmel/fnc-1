A Chinese woman spent an entire week inside a KFC, eating chicken wings and nursing a broken heart, after getting dumped by her boyfriend.

Tan Shen, 26, of Chengdu said she had not planned her extended stay in the fried chicken eatery but wound up there while wandering around depressed, according to Metro.co.uk.

“I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating, I decided I needed time to think,” she said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

After three days in the 24-hour joint, the staffers noticed that the woman had not left. She told them she needed more time to think and ordered more wings with extra large fries.

When she attracted media attention, she finally decided “she was getting sick of the taste of chicken,” so she left and moved in with her parents.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: “I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting!”
