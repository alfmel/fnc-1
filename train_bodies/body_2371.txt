Breaking news: The Teletubbies’ solar infant deity is none other than an English 19-year old.
Which 'Oogieloves' star (yes, there are actual stars) should be most embarrassed? 'Teletubbies' recap: Po voted out of the pod!
The folks at the Mirror U.K. report the true identity of the baby as Jess Smith, a dance-education student at Canterbury Christ Church University. (Not that other Jessica Smith from Laguna Beach; this Smith was vehement in that fact.)
“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story,” Smith told the Mirror.
Smith, who was chosen out of a slew of babies thanks to her smiling prowess, provided evidence of her reign in Teletubbyland—including a letter from the production company of Teletubbies, as well as several profile pictures of herself smiling to prove that she still matches the facial features of the queen of the Tubz. Her payment for lording over those four colorful weirdos for years on end? £250 and a box of toys. Really? They couldn’t wrestle some cash out of Tinky Winky’s purse? Okay.
Smith’s reveal comes at an opportune time, though; the BBC’s childrens’ channel, CBeebies, is planning on making 60 new episodes starring the felt-skinned quartet.
