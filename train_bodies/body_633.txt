Knightscope co-founder Stacy Stephens said rumors that its K5 security robots are roaming Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus are not true.

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

"So people started snapping photos," and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners – but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

"Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer]," Stephens said. "But we have not deployed there."

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

"They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'" Stephens said.

"Unfortunately, that's what people get for not calling us up to confirm things," he added.

So, sorry Microsoft employees. It looks like no robots will be watching over your car in the parking lot — for now.
