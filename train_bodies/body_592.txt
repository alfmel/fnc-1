A 22-year-old man from Macedonia chopped off his own penis after his girlfriend ended their relationship and criticised his performance in bed.

Oliver Ilic, from Kocani, told doctors that his girlfriend had complained about the size of his penis, which led to him mutilating himself with a razor blade.

After being unable to stem the bleeding, Mr Ilic contacted emergency services before being taken to a local hospital. Police found his severed penis in a bin.

Mr Ilic was then transferred to a hospital in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, where he underwent a five-hour operation to reattach his penis.

Doctors said it was too early to tell whether the operation had been successful and whether Mr Ilic would regain the full use of his penis.
