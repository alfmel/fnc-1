Being that it is the first day of spring and many people are highly affected with allergies, it’s probably a good idea that this man is no where near!
The Mirror is reporting that police are on a manhunt for who they believe to be a mid to late 50’s man that slaps people in the head right after they sneeze! What kind of craziness is this?! The first incident happened in Carlisle, Cumbria a city in England, on Monday. The woman sneezed, and right after she got hit in the head by a strange man! Then Tuesday police believe that the same man attacked an 82-year-old woman that sneezed. He immediately slapped her over the head in broad daylight in the same vicinity as the first incident.
Police are asking locals for any help in finding this man. The police force said, “It is very unusual behavior, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.”
A woman who lives near the area also stated, “If anyone smacked me for sneezing, I would smack them back.”
Well, glad he is no where near here!
