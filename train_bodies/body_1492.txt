Robert Plant’s publicist has described as “rubbish” a Daily Mirror report that he rejected a £500m Led Zeppelin reunion. The paper claims Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones had both signed on for the tour deal, bankrolled by Richard Branson, which would have featured John Bonham’s son Jason on drums.

Branson had proposed 35 concerts spanning just three cities, according to the Mirror. The band would fly from London to Berlin to New Jersey in a specially outfitted jet: Branson wanted to recreate The Starship, from Led Zep’s heyday, selling tickets for the plane’s back rows at £100,000 per seat.

“Branson tried to pull out all of the stops,” claimed the Mirror’s source, who claimed it was enough to convince Page, Jones, and Bonham to reprise their 2007 Celebration Day show, and that the band was even considering a further 45-night tour across five more venues. “But even [Branson’s] money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,” the source said. “[He] asked for 48 hours to think about it,” then ripped up the contract in front of a group of promoters. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

Rumours were rife earlier this year that Zeppelin would be reforming, and Page seemed newly furious at his former bandmate. “Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band,” Page said. “[Robert]’s just playing games, and I’m fed up with it, to be honest with you.”

At the end of September, Page said a reunion was no longer “a possibility or on the cards”. He told journalists at an event to promote the reissues of Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy: “I’m not going to give a detail-by-detail account of what one person says or another person says, so there’s not much more I can say about that.” The guitarist explained that he is instead planning to revisit Led Zeppelin material on a 2015 solo tour.
