A sister at an Italian convent has unexpectedly become a mother after giving birth following complaints of stomach pains, local media reports.

According to Corriere Adriatico, the nun had no idea that she was pregnant when she was rushed into hospital by fellow members of the cloistered all-female convent in the central city of Macerata.

When ultrasound showed that she was heavily pregnant, the woman - who is originally from South America - was immediately taken to delivery the baby, the website says.

Asked about the surprise news, the local Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino said it up to the unidentified sister if she wanted to stay within the Church.

He also dismissed calls for the nun to be excommunicated, saying: "Excommunication is something really big and can not be issued for having a baby."
