SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un's younger sister Kim Yo-Jong has taken over the running of the country and is making all the important decisions in her brother's absence, according to a think tank in Seoul formed by North Korean defectors. The North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity reported Wednesday that Kim Yo-Jong convened a meeting of Workers' Party officials in early September and secured their support for her to act as regent while her brother is hospitalized. All party officials have been commanded to continue faithfully carrying out Kim Jong-Un's orders and the military has been put on high alert, the NKIS said. The North Korean government last week publicly admitted that Kim Jong-Un is unwell although it did not elaborate on his health issues.
