(CNN) -- New York City will apparently change its policy on marijuana possession, giving officers the option to merely ticket offenders instead of requiring an arrest, a law enforcement source told CNN on Monday.

The new policy, reported Sunday by The New York Times, is expected to be announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton at a 3 p.m. ET news conference.

Police will have some discretion in deciding whether to issue a ticket or make an arrest, according to the source.

Unlike in some places that have legalized recreational marijuana, New York law still bans possession of the drug. The policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law.
