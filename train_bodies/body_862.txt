THE girlfriend of Olympic champion Michael Phelps has dropped a bombshell — she was born intersex and lived as a boy until her teens.

In a post on her Facebook page, Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, revealed that she was an intersex baby and her birth name was David Roy Fitch.

“I was born with male genitalia with no testicles, but I also have a uterus and no ovaries,” she told Radar Online.

She decided to change her name as a teenager and later underwent surgery to become a woman.

Chandler claims Phelps, 29, was unaware that she was born intersex and that she did not tell him during their relationship.

Chandler, who dated the swimmer before he checked into rehab in September, says she met Phelps on hook-up app Tinder.

The pair met up at the Olympian’s Baltimore home to watch a football game, she told Radar Online.

“One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,” she said.

“Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.”

Phelps was arrested for drunk driving and entered rehab last month.

His ex-lover says she emailed him about her complicated history but he has yet to respond.
