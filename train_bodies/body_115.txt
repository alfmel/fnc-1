Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold uploaded this spine-chilling video of a US Marine getting a direct headshot from a Taliban sniperâ€”only to be saved by his kevlar helmet. It's incredible to watch, especially the face of relief and disbelief of the impact victim. That was a really close call.

According to Arnold, "the Marines were conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013. The shot occurs right at the :45 mark in the video."
