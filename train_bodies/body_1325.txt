According to the New York Post's Page Six, an NBC source says that Tom Brokaw wants Brian Williams' "head on a platter" after the anchor recanted his story about taking incoming fire in Iraq on Wednesday.

"He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report," said the source.

The Post reports that Williams' fabrication was long-known at NBC, but at least one employee thinks the Nightly News anchor is unlikely to be punished.

"He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way," a network source told the paper. "He has the full support of NBC News."
