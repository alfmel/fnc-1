LONDON â€” The identity of the masked executioner clutching a knife in ISIS beheading propaganda videos was revealed on Thursday.

A U.S. intelligence official confirmed to NBC News that a Londoner named Mohammed Emwazi is the person known as "Jihadi John" in the ISIS videos. The militant's identity was first reported by The Washington Post, which cited "friends and others with familiar with his case." The BBC also named the individual without citing sources.

Emwazi is a Briton born in Kuwait who is known to intelligence services, according to the BBC and the Washington Post.

The Washington Post reported that Emwazi grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming before traveling to Syria in 2012 and joining ISIS.

The Metropolitan Police said it would not confirm the reports and British government officials declined to comment.

"Jihadi John" appeared in the videos showing the execution of American hostages James Foley and Steven Sotloff and Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.

He was given his nickname by the U.K. press because he was one of four Britons, dubbed the "Beatles" by their prisoners. He is also thought to have used the nom de guerre "Abu Saleh."

Previously, British and American officials have said they believed they had ascertained his identity.
