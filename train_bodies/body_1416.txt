The wife of British aid worker Alan Henning, who is being held by the the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, released a statement on Tuesday — the second within a week— following new video put out by the terror group where they threaten another British hostage.

In the statement, Barbara Henning says that she had just received a audio file of her husband pleading for his life. She then goes on to appeal to the terrorists' internal sense of justice:

I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State (ISIS) over Alan's fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear. He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid.

We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan's imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.

I have been told that he has been to a Sharia Court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat. I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system.

Please release Alan.

Earlier on Tuesday, militants with ISIS released a new propaganda video in which another British hostage, John Cantlie, compares the fight against the militants to the American quagmire in Vietnam.
