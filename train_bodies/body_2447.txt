The story of English teacher Lucita Sandoval’s affair with a 16-year-old student went viral after video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked. But the video in question is from a porn website, and features a woman and a college student, a local newspaper found.

A salacious sex tape from an Argentinian teacher’s affair with her 16-year-old student is likely nothing more than an Internet hoax.

An Argentinian newspaper debunked the racy story. While the actual tape may be real, it features a woman and a college student ― not a teacher and her pupil, Nuevo Diario reported.

The story of teacher Lucita Sandoval went viral after video allegedly showed the 26-year-old having sex with an underage student from her school in the city of Santiago del Estero. The scandalous story maintained the boy filmed her without her consent and then shared the 23-minute clip with his friends on WhatsApp.

The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it.

But the woman in the video is not a teacher ― and the “boy” is a college student, the Santiago del Estero newspaper found.

While the tape is real, it appears to be from a porn website.

The real woman who appears in the clip, identified by a friend, is from a different Argentine city, Corrientes, the newspaper reported. She does have a teaching degree, but was not employed at the school in question. The newspaper tracked down the man in the video, too, who is well over the age of 16 and in college.

It’s unclear if “Lucita Sandoval” is a real teacher who was the victim of the online hoax or an entirely made-up person.
