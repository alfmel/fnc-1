According to an earlier report, it was suggested by a Reddit user that Apple might have quietly reinforced the iPhone 6 Plus to address the bending issues that users have been complaining about. It sounded good, but unfortunately as it turns out, it might not necessarily have been true, which we have to say is a bit unfortunate.
This is according to the folks at iFixit who responded to the original Reddit post with their own findings. According to the original post, the user claims that his newer iPhone weighs 21 grams more than his wife’s model. iFixit on the other hand who compared a day one model to a newly purchased model only noticed a 0.8 gram difference.
“I just went to the store and bought a brand-spanking-new iPhone 6 Plus, 128 GB, Space Gray, Verizon unit…It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit.” However as noted on the Apple website, there is a small note that reads, “Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.” 9to5Mac’s source also tells them that a difference in 1.5 grams between any two iPhone 6 Plus models is expected.
Like we said this is a little unfortunate as we’re sure many users would have been pleased to learn that Apple could be reinforcing its iPhone 6 Plus models. However as Apple claimed back then, less than 10 users had officially come forward to complain about the reported bending, which means that it wasn’t as widespread as many would have thought it to be, but what say you? Are you a little disappointed by this?
