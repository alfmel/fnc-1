Leak Wars: director is fed up with plot details leaking from the set of The Force Awakens
LAST UPDATED AT 14:41 ON Tue 10 Feb 2015
Unconfirmed reports from Movie Pilot and Ikwiz suggest that director JJ Abrams wants to bring forward the release of the hotly anticipated forthcoming Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, to this summer.

The rumour comes from an industry event – the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 – where Abrams is said to have told attendees he was frustrated with the slow drip of leaks from the set.

According to Movie Pilot, Abrams is worried that the leaked images and plot details will "ruin" the film before it gets to fans. Ikwiz says: "Disney is reportedly taking Abrams's request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release."

The film has been scheduled for release in December this year – with the next two instalments in the series following in 2017 and 2019, according to Disney boss Bob Iger.

Releasing The Force Awakens in the summer would be "an extremely brave move" says Movie Pilot, as it would put the latest Star Wars up against box office heavyweights including Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long-awaited Jurassic World.
