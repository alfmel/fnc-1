HBO plans to launch its stand-alone Net video service next month on Apple TV and other devices, according to the International Business Times.

The news generated a bump in Time Warner  (TWX) stock, pushing it to $83.80. Shares closed at $83.08, down 0.1%, and were down slightly (0.15%) in after-hours trading at $82.96.

Sources familiar with HBO’s plans told IBT that Apple TV was among the devices that the streaming service, to be called HBO Now, would be available on at launch. The price for the service, which like Netflix would not require a pay-TV subscription, would be $15 monthly, sources said.

When contacted, HBO offered this statement: “We know there’s great anticipation around our stand-alone streaming service. And when we have details to share, we will do so.”

Back in October, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said the network planned to debut a stand-alone streaming service in 2015. Various reports, including IBT‘s Wednesday suggest HBO wants service up and running when its series Game of Thrones returns April 12 for its fifth season.

“It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO,” he said at the time.

Neither Apple nor MLB Advanced Media, which is reportedly providing the streaming technology for HBO, had comment on the report.
