The Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been killed as has been previously claimed. He is wounded and being treated in the border area of Iraq and Syria.

A few days ago, it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed by a U.S. airstrike near Mosul in Northern Iraq, an attack that left three other senior members of the militant group dead.

However, a source told Iraqi media that the IS leader and self-proclaimed Caliph has not been killed, but is badly injured as a result of the recent US airstrikes near the Tel Afer and Sinjar areas.

“This is the second time al-Baghdadi has been injured in the last two months and right now he is being treated in a Syrian location close to the Iraqi border,” the source told Iraqi newspaper al-Sabah.

When it was reported that al-Baghdadi had been killed, the Pentagon did not confirm the death, but thousands of social media users shared an unverified photo claiming to be the ISIS leader’s body.

However, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren did later say that any IS leaders “inside troop formations are likely to be killed.”
