Happy Monday! It’s now unofficially Fall, which means you’ll see the word “pumpkin” trotted out even more often than the phrase “Apple product launch” this month.

Brands like Starbucks do not seem to have heeded the “enough with the pumpkin stuff!” warning; as friend of the site Dave Armon of Critical Mention wrote in one of those rare comments worth reading:

“Like it or not, Starbucks is killing it with this story. We spotted 75 airings on U.S. TV and radio stations today, through 5:45 p.m. ET. Personally, I’ll wait until I can see my breath before ordering anything pumpkin flavored.”

This point goes a long way toward explaining why Durex and its PR AOR Virgo Health refused to give Quartz a definitive answer on the most absurd trend to emerge from Twitter this weekend:

If it’s real, the client wins. If it’s fake, the client still wins. Why stop the world from wondering?

For the record, we’re leaning strongly toward fake and 100% unearned.
