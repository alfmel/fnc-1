TORONTO – A Canadian soldier was shot at the War Memorial in Ottawa Wednesday morning, and multiple shots were fired inside Parliament Hill.

According to a witness, the shooter had black hair, was wearing a grey jacket and a scarf.

Witnesses reported gunfire inside the halls of Parliament, including a dozen shots outside the Parliament Hill library.

Police and ambulance are on the scene, and Parliament Hill is in lockdown.


Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. with a report of shots fired.

Witnesses on the scene at the War Memorial said they were in shock; a number of them performed CPR on the victim.

“I’m just trying to grasp it now,” said a male witness, who said soldiers were doing their “normal drill.”

“They were doing their march with their rifle in their hand and he [the suspect] came out on the right hand side here and fired a shot right at one of the soldiers. [The soldier] went down and the other went to his aid. The suspect took off across the street into a vehicle,” he said.
