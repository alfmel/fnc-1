He died of kidney complications due to cancer, his manager said

Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson of the Sugarhill Gang died early Tuesday from kidney complications due to cancer, his manager said. He was 57.

“[Sugarhill Gang's Wonder Mike and Master Gee] had been in contact with him in the past year,” manager David Mallie told FOX411. “They had some great times and created history.”

“So sad to hear of our brother’s passing. Rest in peace Big Bank,” the two remaining members of the group said.

Sugarhill Gang is best known for its 1979 hit “Rapper’s Delight.” Other members of the rap community posted remembrances of Big Bank Hank on social media:

R.I.P. Big Bank Hank. One third of the song that made all of this Hip Hop Music possible. Thanx for opening the door. http://t.co/yrXx9dBo8M
