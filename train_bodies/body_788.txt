The fashion bible’s got a decidedly unglamorous rat problem.
The new 1 World Trade Center offices of Vogue magazine are infested with rodents and editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is not happy, according to a report.
The 25th- and 26th-floor digs of the Condé Nast publication are overrun with vermin, and Wintour has ­issued an edict to staffers to clear her glass-walled office of the long-tailed pests before she steps a stiletto heel on the premises.
Luckily, Wintour is not expected to take up full-time residence at America’s tallest building until after the New Year.
A Vogue employee wrote to Gawker Friday afternoon to say that there are so many creatures scuttling around 1 WTC that the editorial department may be postponing its move from the old Times Square offices.
“A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through,” the staffer said.
Vogue tracked its downtown relocation in a special online story declaring, “Batten the hatches, lower Manhattan, because we’re coming for you.”
The mag’s Instagram account has photos of models and singer Will.i.am hauling boxes.


The article describes the moving scene as a “living Lego set of natty Hermès-colored Rent-a-crates” at 4 Times Square.
Busybodies in a chatroom on the Web site SkyscraperCity.com delighted in the vermin problem that has brought a highbrow publication to a new low.
“Security couldn’t even stop BASE jumpers from ­entering the building and leaping from the top. You think they could stop some rats?” a commenter named “4npower” wrote.
Another commenter, “Lady­Amanita,” speculated that the scourge is overblown.
“Rats probably wouldn’t want to live on the 25th and 26th floors of a high-rise,” she wrote, adding, “It’s possible that they have mice and freaked-out Condé Nasties are confusing their rodents.”
