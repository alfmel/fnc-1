This rumour is ridiculous, but it's pretty amusing and not all that hard to believe given where Zack Snyder is currently shooting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. According to Bleeding Cool (who are often pretty reliable on the rumour front), "The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen." Seriously? The best set video we can get of the iconic vehicle in action is from about 300 feet away, but someone got close enough to steal one of the damn things? As I said, this is hard to believe and we've heard nothing official on this, but if you see the newest version of the Batmobile charging around the streets of Detroit (or even on eBay...), it's probably been stolen! Remember, you can check out the first official image of the Batmobile by clicking here!

UPDATE: False alarm! The Detroit Free Press have confirmed that the Batmobile is safe of the set of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody saying that they reached out to the producers of the movie to confirm that it had not been stolen. "The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs," Woody said in a brief statement which should help us all sleep a little easiter tonight. Oh well, a fun story while it lasted I think we can all agree!
