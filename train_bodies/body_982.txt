A mechanical, singing polar bear could earn its owners an ASBO following complaints that its festive songs were causing a nuisance.

Central Bedfordshire Council is said to be undertaking an ‘ongoing investigation’ into Bernard the bear, who performs to passers by outside The Loft café in Shefford.


An enforcement officer has now visited the café’s owners, warning that Bernard has been causing a public nuisance.

A shop employee told Bedfordshire on Sunday ‘it seems really silly that someone would moan about a bear when we’re on the high street where there is constant noise from the pubs and traffic’.

A spokesman for Central Bedfordshire Council said: ‘We have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation.
