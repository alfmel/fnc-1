The man reportedly attempted to have sex with the teenager in the city of Ganganagar, India, but locals found him down an alley, pinning the terrified girl to a wall.

The 40-year-old was then dragged away by the angry mob of vigilantes while they all decided what to do with him.

Unfortunately for the alleged attempted rapist, what they decided was to take him to a local butcher's shop where they apparently beat him with sticks for an hour.

They then hacked off his penis with a meat cleaver and dumped the remains in the middle of the road, leaving his beaten and bloody body nearby.

Daily Star online has seen the picture of the severed member on the road but we have censored the graphic image.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished”
Local man Aamir Dhawan
Local man Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: "No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

"We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

"This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished."

However, police have taken a dim view of the vigilante attack and have called on those responsible to hand themselves in.

A local police spokesman said: "People cannot take the law into your own hands.

"As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

"We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them."

The man was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl was treated for shock and given counselling.
