If Asbos weren’t out of control before, they could be now, after a six foot mechanical polar bear was allegedly threatened with one.

Bernard the polar bear has stood outside The Loft Café, in Shefford, Bedfordshire, since December 1 and has delighted children with his Christmas inspired singing and dancing.

But staff at the cafe were left stunned on Monday when they got a visit from local council officers.

Owners Rob and Teresa Farndon were told there had been complaints of a noise nuisance and they needed to investigate Bernard’s racket.

Cafe worker Abbie McGee, 19, argued the bear was there for the whole of last December without any complaints but that didn’t seem to make a difference.

‘The children love him and there’s even one woman who used to put 20p in his pocket every time she went past,’ she said.

‘I can’t believe there have been complaints, is no-one allowed to have fun anymore?

Central Bedfordshire Council confirmed they had visited the premises ‘on a number of occasions’ and Bernard was subject to an ‘ongoing investigation’.
