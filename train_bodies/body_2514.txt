So… Rebecca Schoenkopf over at Wonkette is pretty certain that actor Paul Rudd was one of the many bystanders who tackled a violent, homophobic maniac to the ground after he attacked a man in a pink shirt at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport last week. And after reviewing the video, we are pretty sure she’s right.

Check out the guy in the blazer and plaid shirt who runs into the frame at around the 1:20 mark:

A lot white guys look like Paul Rudd, but this guy really looks like Paul Rudd.

And on top of that, thanks to the expert sleuth work of comedian Sara Benincasa, we now know that Rudd was spotted on a flight that left out of Dallas last Thursday. Mediaite has reached out to Rudd’s reps for any confirmation that it is him in the video.

This story was incredible as is, but the presence of one of Hollywood’s most charming, ageless stars just put it over the top.
