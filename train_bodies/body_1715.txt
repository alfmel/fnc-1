A new piece of audio has emerged that allegedly is a recording of the exact moment when Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot unarmed teen Michael Brown on Aug. 9. Six shots can be heard in rapid succession, followed by a brief pause before four more shots are fired. 

According to the New York Daily News, the audio, which surfaced Monday, was recorded by a Ferguson, Mo., resident who can be heard on the tape talking with a woman when gunfire erupts in the background.

CNN aired the tape Monday but was unable to independently verify its authenticity. If the audio is from the exact moment when Brown was shot, then the gunfire heard on the tape clearly reveals that the officer paused before firing more shots. 

"That was what caught my attention initially," said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. "It shows a point of contemplation."

Witnesses have told both police and news stations that Brown, 18, was unarmed and running away with his hands up when Wilson began shooting. An independent autopsy indicates that Brown was hit at least six times, four in his arm and twice in the head.

The Daily News notes that if the audio is verified, the pause in firing could add weight to witnesses' claims.
