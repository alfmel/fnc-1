Big Bank Hank, a member of the early hip-hop group the Sugarhill Gang has died of complications from cancer at age 57. The group were responsible for one of the most popular rap songs of all time, Rapper’s Delight.

The musician died Tuesday at a hospital in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, a business manager for two former members of the group, and Aree Booker, a funeral director with Eternity Funeral Services.

Big Bank Hank, whose real name was Henry Jackson, was born in the Bronx borough of New York. He was a part of the Sugarhill Gang in 1979 when it had hip-hop’s first hit with Rapper’s Delight. The song was released as hip-hop began to emerge as a genre, and landed in the top 40 on the Billboard charts. It also peaked at No 4 on the Hot Soul singles chart, now called the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart.

The Sugarhill Gang, which was formed in Englewood, also included Guy O’Brien (Master Gee) and Michael Wright (Wonder Mike).

“So sad to hear about our brother’s passing,” O’Brien and Wright said in a statement issued through Mallie. “The three of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper’s Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.”

Rapper’s Delight became a success thanks in part to the late record label owner Sylvia Robinson, who released the song on Sugar Hill Records. Robinson, who was known as the “mother of hip-hop”, died in 2011.

After Rapper’s Delight, the trio had minor successes with songs such as Apache and 8th Wonder, but faded away. Their last album was a 1999 children’s rap album, Jump On It!

O’Brien and Wright currently perform under the name Rapper’s Delight Experience Featuring Wonder Mike and Master Gee, Mallie said. Robinson’s son owns the Sugarhill Gang trademark, and O’Brien and Wright haven’t been able to perform under the name since 2010, he said.

The pair were on good terms with Big Bank Hank before he died, Mallie said.
