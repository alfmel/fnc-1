TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) â€” A Texas plumber is getting some unwanted attention after one of his old company vehicles appeared in a photo posted on an Islamic militant group's social media account.

Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City has been flooded with calls after the picture appeared on Twitter, The Galveston County Daily News reported.

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this vehicle, believing AutoNation would remove it.

"They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it," Oberholtzer said. "How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know."

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

"A few of the people are really ugly," he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

"I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth," he said.
