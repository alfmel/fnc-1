An Israeli newspaper report says Islamist websites are claiming extremists have kidnapped an Israeli-Canadian woman who joined Kurdish fighters overseas.

The Jerusalem Post says reports of Gill Rosenberg’s capture surfaced Sunday on websites “known to be close” to Islamic State extremists.

The newspaper says the websites give few details on the alleged kidnapping, only that it occurred after three suicide attacks on sites where Kurdish fighters were holed up.

Clashes between ISIL and Kurdish troops have largely focused on the Syrian city of Kobani, near the Turkish border.

The now-notorious al-Qaeda splinter group is currently in control of large swaths of territory in both Syria and Iraq.

Messages of concern were posted Sunday on a Facebook profile belonging to a Gill Rosenberg. An earlier message asked for advice on joining the Kurdish army.

“Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels” to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday in a statement
