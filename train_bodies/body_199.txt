Christian Bale will not be playing Steve Jobs after all.

The Hollywood Reporter broke the news Monday that Bale had exited discussions on the Steve Jobs biopic being directed by Danny Boyle.

Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had just been on Bloomberg TV stating that Bale was a slam dunk for the part.

"We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Christian Bale," Sorkin said on Oct. 23.

Looks like it's time to find the next best actor.

THR, quoting unnamed sources, reported that Bale "after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw."

A representative from Sony Studios had no on-the-record comment about the report.

Boyle reportedly is in town this week to meet with actors and actresses for the part. Seth Rogen is in discussions to play the key role of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
