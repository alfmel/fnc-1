Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34

Origins: On 6 November 2014, an online rumor claimed actor Macaulay Culkin, best known for his roles in the 1990s Home Alone films, had died. That rumor was based on a Facebook hoax memorial page set up for the star:

At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.

The Facebook page memorializing the still-living star was soon taken down, but not before hundreds of thousands of social network users were duped by its claims. Culkin was photographed after the rumor began to circulate, alive and in the company of his bandmates:

Even though Macaulay Culkin has appeared in public since the death hoax began to circulate, users continued to spread the rumor on 8 November 2014.
