An unverified audio recording that may have captured the shooting of Michael Brown is being investigated by the FBI, according to a report.
News that a recording had surfaced was revealed on CNN, although the network said it had not independently confirmed that the alleged gunshots heard on the tape were from the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9.
In the recording, a man who has not been identified is heard speaking when a series of gunshots can be heard in the background. There is a quick pause and then another round of gunshots are fired. According to CNN, the man lives near where Brown was killed and was talking to a friend online at the time, which is how the ambient sound was recorded. The man didn’t realize what he had recorded initially and only later became aware it could be tied to the Brown case.
According to Lopa Blumenthal, the lawyer representing the man who made the recording, the tape could have “huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”
