Right, let’s put this one to bed quickly. The Vladimir Putin penis motorcade has done the rounds many times before.

Photo of Vladimir Putin's motorcade. Posted without comment.

It is doing the rounds again today. Why today? Because Reddit. Why Reddit today? Who knows. When will it strike again? No one can say. The tides of the internet are mysterious to all but the most experienced of sailors.

It’s not real, it’s a Photoshop job on a still from this video of his 2012 inauguration about 22 minutes in.

This, on the other hand, is an actual picture of Vladimir Putin and a horse.

And this is also an actual picture of Vladimir Putin with a gun.

Happy to help.
