This video is the epitome of a close shave.

This US marine along with two comrades in arms was conducting a raid in the turbulent Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2013.

While leaving cover, a Taliban sniper shot at his head.

Lady luck was on his side with the only visible damage to the kevlar helmet was a tear to its camouflage cover.

Needless to say, this chap had a charmed existence that day…

Definitely should have laid some accumulator bets as soon as he returned to base.
