To be fair, if you've spent £1.5 million on a Bugatti Veyron you probably should put a bit of thought into where you leave it.

Yup, a big old cock and balls was apparently spray-painted on the bonnet of one of the 1200hp supercars in Seattle.

Reaction has been mixed to say the least.

Some were filled with praise.
