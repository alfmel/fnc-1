Seeking information on 'the cub of Baghdadi'; an image of a child, about 10-years-old, being shared online. The child is purportedly the youngest Islamic State fighter to have been killed in Syria. According to some sharing the image of the child, his father is also an ISIS fighter, possibly named Abu Muhammed Al-Absi.  ﻿

Emergent is saying that this is currently unverified. (http://www.emergent.info/cub-of-baghdadi). They say that it has been circulating social media since at least September 26.﻿

I found this picture (from the video) on Twitter.  Twitter's server has it timestamped Fri, 03 Oct 2014 17:06:32 GMT.

I found the twitter feed that uses that picture as its profile pic: https://twitter.com/ISOiOS_2
He started using this as his profile picture on Oct 3.  (Twitter doesn't track profile pictures, but that the Last Modified timestamp from the server, so it reflects when it was uploaded.)

The Tweets from that account stopped on Jul 27 and began again on Oct 3. While the account tweets a lot of propaganda, there is no mention of the kid.  I'm going with "fake".

Update: I found the tweet -- it's from Oct 2.

Wait... Found another tweet from Oct 1:
https://twitter.com/IsIs_omar55/status/517468773201506304

And is this the same kid from Sep 30? (Warning: gory)

The account ISOiOS_2 first tweet was on Sep 29. Odd that he would start up and the next day post one tweet about the kid. It isn't even a long series or a notable tweet.  Still leaning toward fake/propaganda.﻿

Hmmm... none of these are originals. They are all retweets and pictures that have undergone multiple resaves.  (Amazingly, no sign of Facebook as a source.)

Every one of the initial tweets wasn't made popular until over a week later. Even the name "cub of Baghdadi" didn't appear until a few iterations into the retweets/reposts.

The picture of the bloody kid is mentioned on Tumblr as a "her" and not "him", so it may not be the same kid.

No source, no indication that he actually died, nothing to identify when the photos were taken, and no viral coverage until a week after it appeared.﻿

This widely-shared audio track posted to YouTube appears to be related: http://t.co/SsW7KXqRxI - it was first shared on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/saadalaqidy/status/516112443945140224

The Tweet says "Pay tribute to the voice of cub Baghdadi."﻿

Wow... The audio-only video was posted to YouTube on Mar 21, 2014. That is shortly after Al Qaeda renounced ties to ISIS (Feb 3, 2014) and long before the US bombings and before the beheading videos.

I'm still seeing no evidence that the kid in these photos is the "cub" they are talking about or that the kid in the photos is dead.  I'm still leaning toward a fake story and they added photos later and it went viral weeks after that.﻿

That's the wrong tweet I put in, actually. The first share on Twitter was much earlier. ﻿

+Joe Galvin  I'm confused. While I can't understand arabic, I can use Google Translate on the text under the video.  The text says it is about Cub Baghdadi.

If there was an earlier tweet, I'd love to see it!  (I believe you that it exists. I'm curious if it can be traced to even earlier sightings.)﻿

The earliest tweet that mentions the video in relation to "Cub Baghdadi" was about 24 hours before the tweet I put in. https://twitter.com/1Hmdh/status/515922422659170304 - however, as you say, it is curious that vid has been around for so long without being shared or mentioned in relation to this story. Definitely something fishy about this whole thing.
