Let's face it: Many of us hesitate to hand money to the homeless, concerned they will spend it in ways we'd consider unwise. 


But one man put that belief to the test ... and his surprising new video showing what happened after he gave a homeless man $100 has already racked up over 10 million views on YouTube.

Josh Paler Lin, whose YouTube channel has more than 711,000 subscribers and usually features pranks, thought he'd try a social experiment: Give a homeless man money, then follow him in secret to see what he'd do with it.

And sure enough, the man's first stop was at a liquor store. He emerged with a bag and took it to a nearby park. Well, what do you expect, right?

Wrong: Once at the park, the man pulled food from the bag and shared it with his fellow homeless.

"My heart was crushed," Lin told TODAY.


After witnessing what the homeless man, whose name is Thomas, did with the cash, Lin approached him on camera and explained that he'd been following him. He apologized and gave Thomas more money.

Thomas said that he'd quit his job to take care of his sick parents, then lost his family home after they died. He said he's been on the street for four months.

Lin decided to take action, setting up a crowdfunding page to raise money to help Thomas get off the streets. Donations thus far have topped $50,000. 

"People think I changed his life," said Lin, who maintains the video was not staged. "For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life."
