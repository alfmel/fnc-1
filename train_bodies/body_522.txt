A jilted lover in Macedonia has chopped off his own penis after girlfriend told him he was no good in bed, it has been reported.

Twenty-two-year-old Oliver Ilic cut off his organ with a single swipe from a razor blade and then threw the remains in the bin, the metro.co.uk reports.

He allegedly told doctors that he had a small penis and so his girlfriend dumped him.

Ilic contacted the emergency services when he could not stop the bleeding.

He was taken to hospital in the east Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ and the razor blade in a bin.

After doctors couldn't re-attach his penis in Kochani he was transferred to capital Skopje where it was re-attached with his body following five hours of surgery.

The doctors, however, said that it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if the organ would ever function properly again.
