Christian Bale will slip into a mock turtleneck to play Steve Jobs in an upcoming film about the Apple co-founder. (The one that has nothing to do with Ashton Kutcher.)

Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and he's jazzed to have Bale on board. "We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that's Chris Bale," Sorkin told Bloomberg Television, explaining that Bale didn't need to audition.

The movie, based on Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography on Jobs, is named after the Apple idol for a reason. The Jobs character is going to dominate the screen.

"The role is an extremely difficult role. He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined," Sorkin said. "There isn't a scene or frame that he's not in, and there's a tremendous amount of language."

Bale is a good actor, and he has just the right balance of prickliness and genius to nail Jobs. But who is filling the Woz role? Sorkin didn't say. My vote is for Jonah Hill (if the real Woz isn't available, of course.)

Danny Boyle is set to direct, meaning we have an Academy Award-winning screenwriter, director, and actor on board. Meaning this movie might be awesome.

One Steve Jobs movie isn't cool. You know what's cool? Another Steve Jobs movie that doesn't suck. [Bloomberg]
