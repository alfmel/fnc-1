“So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone,” she said on the social media site, according to E! Online. “I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it. I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story. Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven’t changed much either. I am still giggly.”
