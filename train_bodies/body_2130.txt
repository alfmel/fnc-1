Vice founder Shane Smith, with something that is not caviar.  Via twitter.com

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. Here’s our best guess of how Smith and a party of 12 could have racked up a tab the value of a single-family home.

Here’s your check, whenever you’re ready…

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.
