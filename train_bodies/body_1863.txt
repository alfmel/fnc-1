Retraction from Boston.com
Earlier tonight, Boston.com published a piece suggesting Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman sent an email with racist overtones to Sichuan Garden. We cannot verify that Edelman, in fact, sent the email. We have taken the story down.
 
 
 
The Web Sheriff so hot right now.  The Web Sheriff.   We don’t even know what’s true anymore.    Is he sending racist emails or is Boston.com just making stuff up?   I hope it’s real.   To quote Kevin Malone I need to believe in something.
