Oliver Ilic, 22, called medics after he could not stem the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in blood-soaked jeans to hospital.

Mr Ilic told the medics that he felt his small sized penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend and as it was useless decided to cut it off.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade, which was also lying in the bin.

Although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they did not have the competence to reattach it.

Instead Mr Ilic was transferred to a hospital in the capital of Macedonia, Skopje, where surgeons managed to reattach the organ in a complicated five-hour surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off his penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.
