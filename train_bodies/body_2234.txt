A video of an airport worker stripping naked to go through a security scanner in protest at heavy-handed security guards has gone viral.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, who works at the airport in the city of St Petersburg in northwestern Russia, had finished his shift and was going home when he remembered he had left his keys at work.

According to news.com.au, he said: "I returned back to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner. 

"I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict, and security guards were just being heavy-handed.

"When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police."


When officers arrived they also demanded he remove his belt, so Georgy then stripped off everything before walking through the scanner at St Petersburg Pulkovo airport.

He was then allowed to get dressed and leave, but later realised the video had been leaked and he'd become an online hit.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

According to the Mirror, a spokesman said: "We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment."

George himself as filed a complaint against police over the leaked video, adding: "I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh."
