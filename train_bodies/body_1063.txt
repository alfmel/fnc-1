Apple is planning to release its slimmest MacBook yet, boasting a single USB port and 12-inch display, according to a new report.

Rumours site 9to5Mac created artist renditions of the revamped model based on information from sources within the company, which it says in the first major shakeup of the Mac line since the introduction of the Retina MacBook Pro in 2012.

The 12-inch model would slot neatly into the current range, which is comprised of an 11-inch and 13-inch model. The new version is slimmer than both predecessors, but sports the same 'tapered' design from top to bottom.

But such a slimline frame comes at a price; as Apple appears to have done away with standard USB ports and SD card slot. A single USB Type-C port remains, and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space.

Four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation, as the model has no fan. The trackpad is taller than that of the 11-inch model, and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop, with a notably slimmer margin.

UK pricing and the release date of the potential new model remain unknown.

The first MacBook Air was introduced by former chief executive Steve Jobs at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo, where he claimed the company had built the world's thinnest notebook. The MacBook Air replacing the white MacBook as the standard entry model after its discontinuation in 2011.

The news comes as reports circulate that Apple is preparing for the Apple Watch to go on sale by the end of March.
