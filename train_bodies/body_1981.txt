A man caught allegedly attempting to rape a teenage girl was set upon by a vigilante group who hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver.

These horrifying pictures show Suresh Kumar, 40, after he was beaten with sticks for an hour before being castrated in the city of Ganganagar in India.

He was then left bleeding in the road next to his penis and testicles. He was later taken to hospital in a "critical" condition.

The girl was treated for shock and is being given counselling.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: "No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.  "We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and itâ€™s time it stopped.  "This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished."

India has been plagued recently for a string of brutal sex attacks against women and public anger has swelled considerably following an number of high-profile cases.

Despite this, police have called for those responsible for the castration to come forward.

A police spokesman said: "People cannot take the law into your own hands.  "As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.
