A MAN who was dumped by his girlfriend when she told him he was not any good in bed chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin.

The man told medics he felt his small penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless, decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he couldn’t stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also in the bin.

Although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they didn’t have the competence to reattach the member. Instead Ilic was transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje where surgeons managed to reattach it in a complicated five-hour operation.

It’s still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it worked, whether the man’s organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off his penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago, but in his case the penis was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.
