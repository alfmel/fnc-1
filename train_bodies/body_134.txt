WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson took to CNN to publicly counter claims made by Republican Rep. Duncan D. Hunter that Islamic State militants have been detained attempting to enter the United States from Mexico.
"[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas," Hunter told Fox News. The California congressman claimed to have obtained the alleged information from Customs and Border Protection.

Speaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Johnson thoroughly shot down Hunter's claims: "We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect" and calling on American leaders to "not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor."

"I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I'd say to the American public is we're vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border."
