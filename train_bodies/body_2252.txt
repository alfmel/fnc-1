If BuzzFeed has taught us anything, it's that nothing is more basic than pumpkin-spice flavoring. But what about vanilla sex with a pumpkin-spice condom?

This weekend, an image allegedly depicting a Durex pumpkin-spice-flavored condom circulated around social media, exciting basic white girls and the people who want to have sex with them.

Because safe sex is important, no matter what season it is. ðŸŽƒ #pumpkinspice pic.twitter.com/kzHSBgw87a

But as a basic white girl who handed over real American currency last night in exchange for a pumpkin-spice-scented Yankee candle at the Bed Bath and Beyond in Tribeca, it truly pains me to break this news to you: Pumpkin-spice condoms aren't real.

After originally keeping mum about the potential product, Durex provided the following statement to BuzzFeed's Basic White Girl vertical:

"Durex has heard that people are saying we launched a â€˜Pumpkin Spiceâ€™ condom. We canâ€™t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom."

Did a condom company just make a dad joke? Can you believe it's only Monday???
