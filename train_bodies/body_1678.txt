A secret government document has been leaked revealing the "administrative order", telling authorities to ensure no one else is named "Kim Jong-un".

And if people don't agree, then to "train them" to change it.

It is believed anyone with the same name would be forced to have official documents, identity cards and even school certificates altered.

And officials have been told to reject any birth certificates for the name.

The internal policy was obtained by South Korean news station KBS TV and highlights some of the leader's craziest rules.

His name game was said to have been set up by a directive shortly after cheese-loving Kim was made Supreme Leader.

“We'll train them to voluntarily change their names.”
The document reads
The document reads: "All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project."

It is unsure whether the directive is authentic but officials have said that the names of each North Korean leader in the past - Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il - have been banned.

Yet North Korean defector Park Jin-hee, who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive was real.

“There is no one in the North named Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-un."

The news comes after accusations emerged that North Korean officials hacked Sony Pictures and leaked a number of future productions.

The North Korean have refused to comment on the cyber attack.
