The New York Post is reporting this morning that the World Health Organization is looking into whether ISIS fighters in Iraq have Ebola. Yes, that’s two catastrophes combined.

And it’s not just the Post, Mashable had a piece earlier this week about reports from the Iraqi media that ISIS militants have contracted the disease. Their report, however, does contain some response from people with knowledge of whatever’s going on.

Firstly, a WHO spokesperson told them they’ve had “no official notification” from the Iraq government about the cases. And secondly, a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry called the reports “incorrect” and “unfounded,” citing, for one, the the lack of “diagnostic capablities” for doctors in Iraq to confirm cases of Ebola.
