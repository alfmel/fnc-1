An Australian man rather understandably says his trip to Bali was "ruined" when he had a horrifying run-in with a disturbingly determined spider.

Twenty-one-year-old Dylan Thomas's horror story trip began while he was sleeping one night at his hotel: that's when a tropical spider climbed into his bed, burrowed through his appendix scar, crawled under his skin and tunneled into his sternum.

An initial visit to a doctor on Sunday saw him diagnosed as having been bitten by an insect and sent away with antihistamines.

Mr Thomas spent another day with the insect tunneling inside of him before going to a hospital.

"Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily," he told his Facebook friends.

The spider was eventually removed with tweezers. It was dead when pulled out.

Thomas says his friends now call him Spiderman, which is a pretty cool nickname even if you do never have another full night's sleep undisturbed by vivid nightmares again.
