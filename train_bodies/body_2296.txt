North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.
