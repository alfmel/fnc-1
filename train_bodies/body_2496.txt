Warning graphic image: Oliver Ilic, 22, had to call ambulance as he couldn't stop the bleeding after his DIY razor blade operation

A Macedonian man chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin after he was dumped by his girlfriend for his lack of bedroom skills.

The man told medics he felt his small-sized penis was to blame for the split.

And, he said, as it was useless he decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he could not stop the bleeding.

And the jilted lover was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

CEN   Shock injury: Oliver Ilic chopped of his penis and threw it in the bin after he was dumped by his lover

The bloody penis was delivered to the local hospital but a surgeon skilled enough to carry out the reattachment couldn't be found.

Ilic was then transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje, where surgeons managed to reattach the penis in a complicated five-hour surgery.

They said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.
