Lego may have been before its time in terms of its egalitarian attitude if this letter is to be believed.

The note from the 1970s, which was apparently included in a leaflet accompanying a Lego set, encourages parents to let children build whatever they want instead of forcing them to go down gender specific lines.

Since then the company has annoyed some by seemingly reversing this view by targeting its products to either boys or girls.

After an image of the note was uplodaded by reddit user fryd_ yesterday a few people called into question its authenticity, but Robbie Gonzalez, from iO9.com, thought it was probably real.

He wrote: ‘So – is it a fake? Probably not! For one thing, the logo in the note is the one you would expect to find in a Lego pamphlet from the seventies, and is subtly but noticeably different from the more modern Lego logo, which was updated in 1998.’

He also pointed to a German version of the same leaflet that was similar and translated to the same message put on the English note.
