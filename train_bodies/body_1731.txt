A small meteorite struck a wooded area near the Nicaraguan capitalâ€™s airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang, and the crater left by the meteorite measured 40-feet wide and 16-feet, BBC reports. No one was hurt.

Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could be part of an asteroid that passed by Earth Saturday night. International experts have been asked to help local scientists in their investigation.
