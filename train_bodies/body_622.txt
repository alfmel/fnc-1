Breaking!  J.J. Abrams has reportedly approached Disney about moving up the Star Wars: The Force Awakens release date. This comes from the mouth of Abrams himself, addressing a group of attendees at a recent industry event, the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards… this is awards season after-all. Apparently, his desire for secrecy does not apply in this case, as he openly expressed his frustration about the Episode VII leaks.

Adamant about the project’s secrecy, Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously and is looking at a possible summer release. This would put Star Wars up against other giant franchise releases, namely Jurassic World and Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron. Does this make sense for Star Wars' highly anticipated return to the silver-screen?

Earlier this week, Disney issued a subpoena over Star Wars: The Force Awakens leaked photos. This indicates that the company is taking measures to prevent further leaks, making Abrams’ desire to move up the current December 18th, 2015 opening date a very real scenario.



Does this mean we are in the final stages of post-production? How far along is the marketing and promotional art? When will we see the new toys and merchandise? As usual, it’s too soon to celebrate and we now have more questions than before we started.
