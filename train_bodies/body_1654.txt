There may be easier — and less painful — ways to get closer to God.

An Indian spiritual guru and multi-millionaire has convinced up to 400 followers that they should cut off their own testicles, Metro reported.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, 47, said the castrations would bring the men closer to God.

The painful procedures were carried out at a hospital owned by Singh, who is worth $40 million.

He also has around 50 million followers worldwide. Singh has been dubbed the "Guru in Bling."

The men were castrated around the year 2000 but the cases are only now coming to light as Singh is accused of grievous bodily harm by India's Central Bureau of Investigation.

One lawyer for the alleged victims said the men were told "only those who get castrated will be able to meet God."

It is not the first time Singh has been in a scrape with the law.

In 2002 he was charged with conspiracy following the murder of an investigative journalist.

And several female followers have accused him of sexual assault, according to Metro.

Singh has never been convicted.
