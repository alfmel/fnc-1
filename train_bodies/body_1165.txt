As the anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, there are growing fears that stolen jetliners could be used in attacks.
The Washington Free Beacon reports that Islamists in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month when they overran the Tripoli International Airport. There are fears the jets may end up being used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed to the U.S. government over the past two weeks warning that one or more aircraft may be used in an attack on 9/11 or later this month.

"There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes," said one official.

On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi was attacked by terrorists who killed four Americans including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. The attack was originally blamed on an "anti-Muslim video".

Tensions continue to be high across the region. With the rise of ISIS and a second American journalist beheaded, security is going to be on high alert.

A senior State Department counter-terrorism official was asked to comment on reports on the stolen jetliners but he declined. Another said "we can't confirm that."
