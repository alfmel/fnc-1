A luxe Viking island owned by the world's sixth-richest athlete, golfer Tiger Woods, is up for sale, the Telegraph of London reports.
Naturally it has room for putting practice, with half a dozen tee boxes and a golf hole. It also has a private ferry, stables and pasture land, its own protected bay, a "mini-mansion" of a villa, a hunting lodge and a landing strip.

Oh -- and it also has a "hill fort" dating back to the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages that was more recently (about a thousand years ago) a Viking stronghold. Visitors can take forest trails up to the top for views like those ancient man might have seen.

Listing agent Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands confirmed in the Telegraph report: "This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden anymore."

Called Stora Rullingen, it's on Lake Malaren, about an hour from Stockholm. Three international airports are within 60 miles.

Woods married Elin Nordegren, a former model born and raised in Stockholm, in 2004. They had two children -- daughter Sam in June 2007 and son Charlie in February 2009 -- but their marriage unraveled when Charlie was a baby. Nordegren learned during Thanksgiving 2009 that Woods had been cheating on her, and soon after, his very public one-man SUV crash revealed their marital problems to the world.
Subsequent news reports said his dalliances involved perhaps a dozen women. Their divorce was finalized in August 2010.

Vladi Private Islands declines to disclose the asking price except upon application, but a listing at Private Islands Online prices the property at 6 million euros, or about $7.1 million at today's exchange rates. The Vladi listing pegs the property at about 62 acres; Private Islands Online says its about 82 acres.
