Joe Riquelme, creator of the popular iPhone video editing app Videoshop, surprised his parents on Christmas by revealing that he had paid off their mortgage. Riquelme, who goes by “Joey Trombone” on social media, took to YouTube on Thursday to share the touching footage of his parents reacting to his generous gift (see below).

In the clip, Riquelme and his parents are cuddled on a couch when he casually tells them he has one more gift. He then pulled a folded enveloped from his sweatshirt and presented it to his mom. “It has to be a nice present,” she said while opening it. She had no idea.

Inside the envelope, the app developer’s mom found Bank of America documents and a handwritten note from her son that read, “Your house is paid off. Merry Xmas. – Joe.” Riquelme’s mother was stunned. “What?” she asked him, before putting her hand over her mouth and beginning to cry.

When Riquelme’s father reached for the letter, his mom kissed his forehead and expressed her gratitude. “Oh, I love you!” she said. The entrepreneur’s father started to tear up as well, and soon the three were sharing a family hug. Riquelme also shared a photo of the gift and their reactions on Facebook (see below), writing, “Sometimes the best gifts come in the lamest packages. Merry Christmas everyone!” Check out the emotional video below, and tell us what you think!
