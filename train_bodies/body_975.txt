Brian Williams took a moment on Monday’s “NBC Nightly News” to push back on a social media dustup over a Saturday night liveshot that didn’t quite happen. Mike Seidel appeared on camera Saturday night with his back turned, leading some to speculate the reporter may have been relieving himself.

No so, geniuses:

Social Media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel Meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night: Lester Holt threw to Mike’s live report in a snowstorm in North Carolina. Mike had lost cellphone contact with our control room.. so he couldn’t hear through his attached earpiece that he was on the air. He put his back to the storm and the camera.. he had to take off his gloves and re-dial his phone which was tethered to his ear, that’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow. It was just Mike working to make it right — which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.
