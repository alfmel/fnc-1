Iraqi group ISIS beheaded American photo-jornalist James Wright Foley, releasing gruesome pictures and video to the internet on Tuesday. Foley had been missing after being captured in Syria in 2012 while working freelance for AFP.

A group called Free James Foley had been dedicated to finding and saving Foley since his disappearance. The search met its devastating end on Tuesday when the Iraqi group issued video proof of his murder, and threatened more to come: The Daily Beast reports that Time journalist Steven Sotloff is also shown in the video, and that ISIS threatens he will be next if the U.S. doesn’t cease and desist its operations in Iraq.

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty & safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” an ISIS member says in the video.
