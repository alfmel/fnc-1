This is possibly the best resignation letter I’ve ever seen. No, scrap that. This IS the best resignation letter I’ve ever seen.

An iPhone game developer quit his job by hiding a secret message at the end of a game he worked on called Electric Boogie. To see the message you have to get 100 points on the final level.

Well this innocent gamer did get 100 points but the last thing he expected to see was a very explicit animation and message to the boss of the developing company.



If you couldn’t read it, the message said:

Brody –

Working for you is a living hell. You hav eyour head so far up your ass, it’s no wonder your breath always smells like shit. Consider the cartoon animation and this letter, my resignation from you pathetic company. I quit.
