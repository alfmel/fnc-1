Soldiers searching for dozens of students missing after clashes with police at a demonstration in southern Mexico have found a mass grave full of bodies too burned or disfigured to be identified, officials said.
The mass murder near the rural town of Iguala, in the crime-hot state of Guerrero, may be one of the worst massacres since the clampdown on Mexicoâ€™s drugs gangs began eight years ago, and suspicion has fallen on local police links to a gang known as Guerrero Unido.
