Islamic State fighters are no match for Ebola.

The World Health Organization is investigating whether some ill jihadists have contracted the killer disease, two sources at the agency told The Post.

Agency officials are checking if there are Ebola patients at a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad, sources said.

Al-Sabah, an Iraqi pro-government newspaper, reported this week that the fighters were being treated for Ebola, while some of their comrades have come down with HIV brought by foreign extremists “coming from many countries, particularly those in Africa.”

“The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don’t have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus,” ministry spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told Iraqi media Thursday. “They are incapable to detect it.”
