Once again, rumors that Macaulay Culkin died have flourished online. But, once again, he's not dead.

The 34-year-old's representatives confirmed that the actor and musician is very much alive, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The flurry of RIPs on social media sites were due to an online death hoax cooked up about the child star of the Home Alone film series. Earlier this year, a similar death hoax surfaced, but it was also dismissed by Culkin's representatives at the time.

A Facebook memorial page announcing the actor's death sparked the rumors, according to fact-checking site Snopes.com. The Facebook page has since been taken down.

Culkin was photographed with his band, Pizza Underground, after the fake death news started swirling.
