Two Aussie mates had to be talked out of the gnarly honour of eating what they claim is the world's oldest burger, which they bought at an Adelaide McDonald's 20 years ago.

According to the pair, Casey Dean, then 14, and 13-year-old Eduard Nitz stopped off at their local restaurant in the mid-90s to pick up some burgers.

In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.

He never turned up, instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next.

Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.

"We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world," Mr Dean said.

"It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

"The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping."

The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on The Project tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.

But common sense prevailed when the showâ€™s hosts protested, and they left the decades-old meal for another day.

The burger's Facebook page, Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?, has attracted 3000 likes in one week.

The duo also selling a Free the Burger song on iTunes for $1.69, with proceeds going to Beyond Blue.
