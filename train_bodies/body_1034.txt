(Reuters) - A Canadian soldier was shot at the Canadian war memorial in Ottawa and a shooter was seen running towards the nearby parliament buildings where more shots were fired, according to multiple media and eyewitness reports on Wednesday.

The buildings were put in lockdown as police and tactical teams converged on the area. The shooting comes two days after an Islamic convert ran down two Canadian soldiers, killing one, near Montreal.
