The CBI registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 men

The CBI has registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, in connection with the alleged forced castration of 400 of his followers.

The agency has registered a case of criminal conspiracy against the Dera chief and his other followers for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, among other charges, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) .

The case has been registered on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

A petition was filed in the high court in 2012 by a follower of Dera demanding a CBI inquiry and compensation for his alleged castration in 2000, CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said.

Prasad added that petitioner Hansraj Chauhan has alleged that around 400 male devotees, including himself, belonging to Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, were castrated at the Dera after its head (Ram Rahim) falsely claimed that the castration would lead to “realisation of God through him”.

Justice K. Kannan of the high court passed the order on the petition ordering a CBI inquiry into the incident.

The court had earlier ordered a medical examination of the petitioner from the government multi-speciality hospital which found that he had indeed been castrated.

In a report submitted before the HC, the state government had said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons associated with the Dera head and all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated.
