The latest major hoax, 'Days of darkness' has finally been dispelled after satirical news site Huzlers.com wrote a story claiming that the world would be plunged into six days without light during December.

This rather bold -- and entirely fake -- claim by the website was further entrenched into people's minds by the fact that it listed Charles Bolden, NASA administrator as the source of the claim.

Huzlers.com claimed that the cause of the blackout was, 'due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.'

The story went viral with panicked and concerned citizens immediately turning to Twitter to voice their concerns over the worldwide blackout.

Incredibly this isn't the first time that NASA has had to combat a worldwide blackout story as in 2012 a rumour surfaced that the Earth would be passing through a 'Photon Belt' causing the planet to be plunged into darkness.
