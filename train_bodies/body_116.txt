The woman, who belonged to an order in Macerata, Italy, was rushed to hospital by her fellow sisters and soon after gave birth

A nun has stunned her fellow sisters and mother superior after GIVING BIRTH to a baby boy after suffering severe stomach pains.

The woman, who belonged to an order in Macerata, Italy, said she had no idea she was pregnant when she was rushed to hospital in agony.

The nun, who is originally from South America and arrived at the convent in June, was taken to the emergency department of Bartolomeo Eustachio di San Severino Marche by her fellow sisters.

The baby was born healthy but remains in hospital to undergo further checks.

The nun's convent has even expressed an interest in taking care of the mite, according to L'Unione Sarda.

It is not the first time a nun has given birth unexpectedly.

Last year, a 31-year-old Salvadorean nun in Italy gave birth to a baby boy, whom she named after Pope Francis.
