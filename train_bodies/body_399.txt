A religious cleric in Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa ruling forbidding the building of snowmen.

Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid was asked whether it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for children after a snowstorm in the country's north. His response:
It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.

– SHEIKH MOHAMMED SALEH AL-MUNAJJID
Quoting Muslim scholars, he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, which is considered sinful under the country's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

The ruling does open up the possibility of the building of a snowapple.
God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.

– SHEIKH MUNAJJID
The fatwa comes after a number of social media users from Saudi Arabia have been posting images of snowmen and camels online, and has prompted lively debate. One user who appeared to take umbrage at the fatwa said:
A people looking for a fatwa for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa

– TWITTER USER
Whilst another praised the cleric for "recognising matters even Satan does not think about".
It is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism. May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about.
