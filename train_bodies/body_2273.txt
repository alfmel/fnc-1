When Tim Cook unveiled the Apple Watch back in September, its official launch date was set as the oh-so-vague “Spring 2015.” Now, we have our first guess as to what that launch date could actually look like. 9to5Mac reports that the Apple Watch is set to ship in the U.S. by the end of March, with Apple Store retail training scheduled for mid February.

According to the report, Apple will be sending representatives from Apple Stores to Apple’s offices in Cupertino or Austin, Texas to learn about the Watch, which will better prepare store employees for when the Watch arrives. In addition, the report states that Apple is finishing up work on the Apple Watch’s software, battery life, and inductive charging mechanism.

No word if every version of the Watch will ship in March, and of course these dates could change, as we get closer to launch. But for now, I’m imagining the rose gold Watch Edition sitting (maybe not so) delicately on my left wrist. The basic Watch will start at $349.
