A group, allegedly named RIP Macaulay Culkin, gained thousands of 'likes' online before being removed

Macaulay Culkin has been the victim of a death hoax - again.

For the second time this year the actor has had false reports circulate online regarding his sudden death.

But once again it turns out that the Home Alone star is actually alive and well.

The rumour seems to have originated online with a mock tribute page making the rounds on Facebook for people to show their respect.

Mourners were going off a fake report, which read: “At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

"Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”

The social media page, believed to have been named 'RIP Macaulay Culkin', has since been removed but at one point allegedly garnered hundreds of thousands of 'likes'.

However a picture uploaded by the 34-year-old's band, Pizza Underground, showed him to still be living.

The photo, uploaded on Friday, showed the former child actor surrounded by his bandmates and looking at a laptop

Users have since reacted angrily to being duped and hit out at those who started the hoax.

One person tweeted: "So it turns out Macaulay Culkin is not dead. Why do people think it's hilarious to spread these type of rumours? Silly potatoes."

Whereas another joked: "I'm hearing rumours that Macaulay Culkin is dead. Has anyone been round his house? He's probably there. Alone."

We have reached out to Macaulay's reps for a comment.
