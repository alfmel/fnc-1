So shocking! A cloistered South American nun gave birth to a baby boy in Italy after complaining to her mother superior and sisters of severe stomach pains.
The nun apparently had “no idea” she was pregnant before she gave birth at Bartolomeo Eustachio Hospital in San Severino, Italy.


Pregnant Nun Gives Birth To Baby Boy In Italy
What a strange story. The unnamed South American woman, who belonged to an order of nuns in Macerata, Italy, said she wasn’t aware she was pregnant before giving birth, according to the UK’s Daily Mail.

Her fellow sisters were the ones who rushed her to the emergency department at a nearby hospital. The sister is believed to have been impregnated before she arrived at the Italian convent in June 2014.

The sisters say that they are interested in taking care of the baby if the nun does not wish to keep it, according to a report in the Italian newspaper L’Unione Sarda.

Surprisingly, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened. In fact, in 2014, a 33-year-old Salvadorean nun living in Italy gave birth to a baby boy.

It seemed like it was meant to be though because the sister said at the time that she couldn’t be happier about her unexpected bundle of joy.

“I am so happy,” she said about the child, whom she named after Pope Francis. “He is a gift from God. I feel more of a mother than a nun.”
