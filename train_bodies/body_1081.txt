Kim Jong-un has broken both his ankles and is in hospital in Pyongyang recovering from surgery, according to a South Korean newspaper.

It is believed the injury is a direct result of his excessive weight. The North Korean ruler is believed to weigh over 20 stone, reportedly due to his heavy drinking and an overindulgence in Swiss cheese.

"Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended," an anonymous source was quoted as saying in the Chosun Ilbo, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The 31-year-old leader had been absent from the public eye for more than three weeks and missed an important parliamentary session last week, fuelling speculation about his ill health.

In a rare display of honesty about their leader's health, the North Korean government finally confirmed last week that Kim Jong-un was suffering from an "uncomfortable physical condition", The Guardian reports. 

The operation on his ankles was reportedly carried out in mid-September and Kim is believed to still be in hospital under heavy security, amid speculation that European doctors have been flown in to treat him.
