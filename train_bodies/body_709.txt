A hoax story about street artist Banksy being arrested in Watford has duped internet users.

US website National Report alleged the Metropolitan Police had held the elusive graffiti artist after he was traced by a "24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force".

It claimed his art studio in the capital had been raided and “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” found.

The story also said documents identified the anonymous artist as 35-year-old Paul Homer, from Liverpool.

He was said to be in custody “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

However, Scotland Yard confirmed the story - which left Banksy's name trending on Twitter - was fake.

A spokesman said: "We are certainly not aware of Banksy being arrested in Watford, or anywhere else for that matter."

The story hit a chord with Louise Mensch, the former Conservative MP who is active on Twitter.

She fell for the scam and criticised the Metropolitan Police for not focusing on the "so many other criminals out there".

But she quickly apologised when she was alerted to the story being a prank.

The story fooled thousands of others on social media, who expressed shock that the infamous artist had been unmasked at last.

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) October 20, 2014

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?

However, there were several clear discrepancies in the National Report story.

It mentions Banksy was arrested by the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police, which are different forces.

The report quotes "London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards", which is a fictional name, and uses a picture of an arrest ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival in 2011.
