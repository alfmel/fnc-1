A gunman fired multiple shots at the National War Memorial in Ottawa on Wednesday and shot a Canadian soldier, Reuters reports.

The gunman then ran towards Parliament Hill, which is located across the street from the National War Memorial. According to Member of Parliament Bob Zimmer, the intruder was shot inside the Parliament building.

The incident comes just a day after police killed a Muslim convert in Quebec after he had hit two soldiers with his car.

From the Associated Press:

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Police say a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial has been by an unknown gunman.

Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. Wednesday with a report of shots fired, and witnesses reported seeing a gunman running toward Parliament Hill, which is under lockdown. Others on the Hill told Canadian Press they heard shots being fired in several different corridors.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

Emergency responders are still on the scene and paramedics took the wounded soldier away in an ambulance.

The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over - and one of them killed - in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies.
