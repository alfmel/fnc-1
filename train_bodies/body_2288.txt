The copper box was entombed in the state capitol in 1795

Someone call Nicholas Cage because Bostonians may have just discovered a new real-life national treasure.

A time capsule from 1795 in the form of a small copper box was unearthed in Massachusetts statehouse in Boston Thursday. The container was first placed in the cornerstone of the building on Beacon Hill by revolutionary war hero Paul Revere and the then-governor of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams.

The cigar-box sized capsule will be x-rayed over the weekend and its contents revealed next week. The artifact is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in Massachusetts, making it by default one of the oldest such items in the United States.

During the excavation, coins fell out of the plaster that held the box in place, good luck tokens tossed in with the box when it was unearthed and reburied in 1855, the last time the time capsule was uncovered, The Boston Globe reports.
