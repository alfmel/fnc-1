A NUN in Italy was rushed to hospital with stomach pains only to discover she was pregnant and about to give birth.

Italian media reports that the nun, 31, originally from South America, was part of the all-female convent in Macerata.

She is believed to have been pregnant when she arrived from South America in June.

Doctors performed an ultrasound only to discover that the woman was heavily pregnant. She was taken to the delivery room where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy soon after.

The Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino said it up to the unidentified sister if she wanted to stay within the Church. It has been reported that the nuns want to help raise the baby together at the convent

He also dismissed calls for the nun to be excommunicated, saying: “Excommunication is something really big and cannot be issued for having a baby.”
