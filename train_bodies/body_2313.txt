The cheese-loving tyrant was last seen in public on September 3 and has since missed a number of high-profile events.

There are persistent rumours Kim has been replaced and his sister Kim Yo Jong is running the country.

A defected army official recently said North Korea, one of the world's poorest and most isolated countries, is "in the midst of a civil war".

Some have claimed that Pyongyang, the capital, has been shut down and Kim has fled the city.

"This sort of action suggests there has either been an attempted coup or that the authorities there have uncovered some sort of plot against the leadership," Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda Universtity, told the Telegraph.

However South Korean media claim that Kim is still in control but struggling with a variety of illnesses with his sister acting as leader in his absence.

Yonhap suggest Kim, who came to power after the death of his father Kim Jong-il, is suffering from gout, diabetes and high blood pressure".

Kim recently underwent surgery after breaking both his ankles following an arduous tour of military bases and factories in a pair of Cuban heels.

Western governments have responded sceptically to news Kim may have been forced out and described the endless rumours as wishful thinking.

"The last time was when everyone was predicating that Kim Jong-un would be pushed aside by his more experienced uncle," one Washington source told the New York Times.

"And look what happened to him."

That uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed by his nephew last year.
