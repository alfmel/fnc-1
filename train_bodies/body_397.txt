No less than seven school girls fell pregnant during a five day school trip recently.

Parents of the girls, who are aged between 13 and 15-years-old, are furious at the school and say the children were not properly supervised.

The girls, from the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, were in the capital of Sarajevo to visit Museums and historical sites.

While the parents are angry at the school administrators, the teachers say the blame lies with the parents, who they claim have failed to teach their children about safe sex.

The case has reignited an ongoing national discussion in Bosnia concerning the worrying increase in teenage pregnancies.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo, told MailOnline: ‘It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

‘We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.’

The seven pregnant girls have all reportedly left school.
