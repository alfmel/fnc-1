Twitter users are suggesting the phallic daubing could have been the handiwork of a jilted lover or jealous rival

The owner of a £1.5 million Bugatti Veyron supercar could be left with a £500,000 dent in their pocket after crude vandals painted a huge penis on its bonnet.

Yobs targeted the silver-coloured car which was parked in a street in Seattle, US.

The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport is the world’s most expensive production car and is capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.6 seconds.

But its flashy owner will be reeling, as the graffiti is set to slash a whopping half a million pounds off the racing car's retail value.

The image was posted on Reddit this week, with some users condemning the graffiti artists for vandalism and other suggesting it was the handiwork of a jilted lover.

One Twitter user even suggested it could be a sign of activism by the culprit.

A spoof account for Iron Man Tony Stark also claimed to be the owner, tweeting: "Yes they were in good condition, besides the fact there was a penis on my Bugatti Veyron..."
