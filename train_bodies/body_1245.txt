YouTuber Josh Paler Lin is normally a prankster, but recently he decided to try a social experiment.

He gave a homeless man $100 and followed him to see how he spent it.

Expecting the guy to buy booze, Lin was shocked to see his subject walk out of a liquor store with bags full of food which he shared with other homeless people in the area.

The man told Lin: "There's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing."

His actions touched the YouTube prankster so much, Lin handed over another $100.
