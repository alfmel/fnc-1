In quite recent news, J J Abrams has reportedly said at the Visual Effects Society Awards (2015) that he may release his extremely anticipated film, Star Wars: Episode VII â€” The Force Awakens. instead of winter he may move his film down the line for a summer release! This is an extremely brave move (if true) as it puts Star Wars up against films like Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long awaited Jurassic World but who would win at the summer box office if it were to happen? In my opinion Star Wars has got the strongest chance at the box office if moved to a summer release but why would he do it? All the big films come out in the summer and I mean there's no Hobbit to compete with in December so why move it down to Summer?

Box office championship.

J J's biggest reason was reported to be that all of the Star Wars plot leaks and pictures of characters had sent him on a little scare that more and more would be leaked therefore making the film predictable and not worth watching. For example just one photo can give away a lot for instance: (If you don't want spoilers look away!)

Sorry J J!

For instance these 5 figures reveal the character's Kylo Ren, Rey, Fin, BB-8 and shows us what Kylo Ren (ol' crossguard) will look like with his outer cloak removed. I do see that if more of these pictures are leaked we could be seeing what Han, Leia, Luke, C3PO etc. will be like in the film before seeing a company made trailer, which would ruin the surprise. Disney, being the owners of the new Star Wars franchise, have taken J J's thoughts into consideration and deep thought which could get the film released a lot earlier than we thought we were going to see it! There are some bad things about this though... If we do get what we all wish for and we get to see Star Wars 7 about 6 months before we thought we were going to, won't Disney be in a panic? If they thought that their blockbuster was coming in December would they have ordered toy designs, trailers etc. for later on in the year? Perhaps this is just paranoia but Disney and J J will have a lot of work to get done if they want their merchandise etc. to come alongside Star Wars in summer.
