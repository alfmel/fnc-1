First, there was #BendGate. Reports flooded the media that claimed the iPhone 6 Plus was susceptible to bending when kept in your pocket.

Now, there's #HairGate. A 9to5Mac community post reveals that iPhone 6 customers are complaining on social media that their new phones keep ripping out chunks of their hair when they hold the phone up to their ear to take a call.

Twitter users say their hair is getting caught in the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6.

My hair keeps getting caught in the microscopic seam between glass and aluminium on my iPhone 6

@9to5Community My iPhone 6+ was pulling my hair too; I returned it, it was underwhelming:(

The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out. #seamgate

Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it during calls. #hurts #beardgate

@EmilyDreyfuss No, its my head hair. I have long hair so it happens when there's a seam on the front of a phone like the iPhone or HTC One.

This news follows #GapGate, which focused on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Customers complained to Samsung that their new Android phones had a gap between the screen and the case. It's unknown whether Samsung customers are also experiencing hair loss when taking calls on their phones, as some iPhone 6 users are now reporting.
