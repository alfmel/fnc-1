Unlucky in love Yang Hu was so fed up with not having a girlfriend that he chopped off his own penis -because he had no real use for it.

The depressed 26-year-old believed there was no chance of ever finding a partner due to his long work hours.

So in desperation he cut off his penis in a bid to stop himself thinking about finding love.

Realizing his mistake Yang cycled to the hospital to get treatment only to be sent home by shocked doctors who told him to retrieve his severed penis so they could attempt to reattach it.

However, when he returned he had lost too much blood and so surgeons were unable to save it.

Yang's friends said that he had been increasingly depressed about the fact that since moving to the city he could not find a girlfriend.

They said that his long hours working in a clothing factory in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province in east China, meant he doubted he would ever have a chance to meet a woman.
