To the victor go the spoils, and for Tiger Woods, winner of 14 major golf championships and one of the richest athletes on the planet, the spoils include, among other things, a private island in Sweden.

Woods, who is expected to make his 2015 debut at the Phoenix Open later this month, has put the 62-acre island near Stockholm on the market for about $7.1 million.

Situated in Lake Mälaren, the private island features a villa, a hunting lodge, guest quarters, horse stables, a dock and a landing strip for propeller planes, as well as a structure of historical significance: an 11th century Viking stronghold.

The main villa, fashioned in log cabin style, spans about 2,475 square feet with a chef’s kitchen, a dining area and a living room fireplace. Adjacent from the villa is a spa and a pool built around a rock outcrop.

Elsewhere on the grounds are six golf tee boxes.

Two smaller islands and a 494-acre water area for hunting and fishing are included in the sale. What’s not included is the furniture; the property is being marketed as unfurnished, according to Vladi Private Islands, the real estate agency that holds the listing.

Woods, whose career earnings eclipsed the $1.3-billion mark last year, announced that he would take part in the Waste Management Phoenix Open starting Jan. 29, followed by Torrey Pines in La Jolla in February. He was limited to seven PGA Tour events last year due to injury.
