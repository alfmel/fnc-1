The missing American freelance photo-journalist James Wright Foley has reportedly been beheaded by ISIS - in a message to the United States to end its intervention in Iraq.
Foley has been missing since November 22, 2012, reporting from Syria.
ISIS posted extremely graphic pictures and video online to social media as proof of their barbaric action.
The group which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group.
