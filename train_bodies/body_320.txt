Over the weekend, NBC anchor Lester Holt cut to a satellite feed in Sugar Mountain, NC, for a report from weatherman Mike Seidel. Except Seidel apparently wasn’t ready to go on air and appeared to be urinating in the woods. After he finishes whatever he’s doing, he appears to then zip up his fly and put his gloves back on.



NBC claims Seidel was merely “checking his phone,” which he had clumsily dropped in the snow. But there are a lot of unanswered questions: Why didn’t one of the PAs in the film crew grab his phone for him? Why has he been so reluctant to talk about the issue on Twitter? Is he even in Sugar Mountain?

It sounds like a cover-up for a vast, troubling media conspiracy.
