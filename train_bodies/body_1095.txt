North Korea leader Kim Jong-un is so fat from eating cheese that he has broken his ankles.

The tubby tyrant is recovering from surgery after weight gain caused him to fracture his joints.

Metro reports that daily binges on Emmental are believed to be responsible for the his rapid weight gain.

An unnamed source told South Korea's largest newspaper Chosun Ilbo: "I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended."

The source added that the 31-year-old dictator had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.
