Lebanese authorities are holding a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of the ISIS jihadist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the interior minister said. It was initially reported that a wife and son of the self-proclaimed “caliph” had been arrested in November.
The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, interior minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday. He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi’s child.
“Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,” he said.
“Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,” Mr Mashnuq added.
“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Mr Mashnuq said.
