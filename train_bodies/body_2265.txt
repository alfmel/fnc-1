In further trouble for Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, Punjab and Haryana High Court has ordered a CBI probe into the allegations of forced castration of his followers inside the ashram. Justice K Kannan of the High Court passed the order on a petition filed by Hansraj Chauhan, a former follower of the Dera.

In his petition, Chauhan had claimed that he along with around 400 saints of 'dera' were castrated inside the ashram, Chauhan's counsel Navkiran Singh said.

Chauhan said in the petition that they were assured that those who would get castrated will be able to meet God through the dera head.

Taking cognizance of the petition, the HC had earlier ordered medical examination of petitioner Chuahan from the government multi-specialty hospital (GMSH) at Sector-16, Chandigarh.

The GMSH authorities examined Chauhan and found that he has been castrated, Singh said.

Seeking a CBI probe, Chauhan has also claimed before the High Court that castration process of dera followers is being done by Gurmeet Ram Rahim through doctors are employed in his hospital.

Besides, in a report submitted before the High Court, the state government said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons, associated with the dera head, in which all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated, Singh said.

The dera chief, who is going to hit the big screen next month with his film 'Messenger of God (MSG)', has already courted controversy with Sikh organisations, including Akal Takht, seeking a ban on it.

He has not only played the lead role in the movie but also produced it and sang songs.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim is also facing trial in courts in connection with a case of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples.
