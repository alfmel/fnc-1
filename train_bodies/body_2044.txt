A married TV actor who met a young woman and kissed her in a sauna woke up to find his testicles had been stolen.

Dmitry Nikolaev, 30, is believed to be the target of a gang – including a doctor – which may be harvesting organs to sell on the black market.

Nikolaev had a drink with a young blonde woman he met at a bar in a Moscow theatre before she invited him to a sauna, reports MailOnline.

A police source told the website: ‘They kissed and had some more beer and after that the actor remembers nothing.’ They believe Nikolaev’s drink was spiked.

He woke up the next day at a bus stop in acute pain and noticed blood on his trousers.

At the hospital staff told him that his testicles had been removed and that it appeared the operation had been done by a medical professional.

Police believe the gang is stealing human organs to sell on the black market.
