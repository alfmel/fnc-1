The sister of the British-born American photojournalist, Luke Somers, held captive by al-Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claims he was killed in a failed rescue attempt.

Lucy Somers told the Associated Press that FBI agents had informed her of the 33-year-old's death. She went on to say: "We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace."

There has been no comment by US officials. The news comes after the Yemeni Defence Ministry had stated a joint US-Yemeni armed forces operation had freed "an American hostage" in a mission that killed 10 al-Qaeda members, Reuters reported.  Luke Somers was kidnapped by militants last September while working for the Yemen Times.   On Thursday, the extremist group posted a video threatening to kill Somers in three days if the US did not meet their unspecified demands. Following this, the Pentagon confirmed it had previously launched a failed attempt to rescue Mr. Somers.
