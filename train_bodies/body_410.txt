CORSICANA (October 14, 2014) Navarro County officials Tuesday emphatically rejected as false a posting on the National Report website that said the small town of Purdon was quarantined because a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus after the father began to exhibit symptoms following a business trip to Dallas.

The Corsicana Daily Sun reported that local emergency management officials, the Corsicana-Navarro County Public Health District and county officials all say there’s no truth to the claim that federal officials closed down the town of about 130 residents.

"A release today on at least one website, National Report, stated that “The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus. This report is entirely false,” Navarro County Judge H.M. Davenport said in a statement.

"Local authorities, emergency management, and county government have been inundated with calls concerning this false report. Please be assured if this were accurate information, you would have been notified immediately from accurate sources first,” Davenport said.

"Please ensure that you utilize accurate information sources when looking on social media and any unknown news sources,” Davenport said.
