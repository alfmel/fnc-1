Rajasthan, Oct 14: A man learnt a lesson, the hard way. Attempting to rape a teenager in public cost him his penis. A 46-year old man, Suresh Kumar was seen pinning a teenager to the wall in Ganganagar in Rajasthan. The next moment, he saw his penis chopped off and thrown on the road. He was dragged and taken to a local butcher shop where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour. Thereafter, his asset was hacked with a meat cleaver and dumped in the middle of the road. According to the Daily Star, the man was abandoned bloodied and bruised, with no one helping him. One local said,"No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime." Calling it a message for the people with perverted mindset, the man further added,"We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hanged, and molested, and it's time it stopped." The police, however, have condemned the attack and warned locals not to take laws in their hands. They have further asked those involved in the deed to hand themselves in. A police officer said,"As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice." OneIndia News
