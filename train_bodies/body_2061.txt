Awwwww!
This is such a heartwarming story!
When YouTuber Josh Paler Lin gave $100 dollars to a homeless man, he hoped he could videotape the man wasting the money away on alcohol.
But all Josh got was a shock, because Thomas, the homeless man, went into a liquor store, but came out with enough food to support everyone around him!

With the hundred dollars, Thomas chose to help as many other homeless people he could find in an Anaheim park while also moving Josh in the process.
Josh immediately felt guilty for assuming worst of Thomas, and on top of giving him an extra $100 on the spot, has already raised over $44,000â€¦ and this video only went live on Monday!
