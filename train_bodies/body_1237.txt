Details are slim as Bleeding Cool mentions they heard it, but not from whom, and they state WB hasn't responded to inquires.

It's known that there are at two versions of the Batmobile in Detroit as two were spotted recently under a tarp.

This isn't the first time the film has had issues in Detroit as reportedly Henry Cavill almost got into a fight with a bunch of Detroit locals at a bar that dub themselves the "Deaf Wolfpack."
