In response to Ebola Scare in Kansas City :
Via KCTV - 5:
The person who was rushed to Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri Saturday night is a man - not a woman as previously reported, and hospital officials now say the patient is not being treated for Ebola. 
HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.
Last night, it was reported that all or part of the medical facility was under quarantine. It is still unknown what the Nigerian man is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.
This afternoon when Breitbart News checked, the apartment building was no longer cordoned off.
Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.
