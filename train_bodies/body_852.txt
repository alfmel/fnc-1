After a solid week of coming to terms with the fact that Steve Jobs is Batman, we've found ourselves in a Job-less world once more. Now that Christian Bale's thrown in the tiny circular glasses, we ask you, dear readers, who's your Jobsian ideal?

Is it Woody Harrelson you see telling you to stay both hungry and foolish? Garey Busey perhaps? Or maybe even Meryl Streepâ€”because who cares! Anyone's better than Ashton.

So share your top picks down below, and help us find the perfect Steve to Seth Rogan's (presumably) stoned, ever-guffawing Woz.
