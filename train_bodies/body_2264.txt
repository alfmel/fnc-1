MANAGUA, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- A Nicaraguan commission charged with investigating a possible meteorite crash over the weekend presented an initial report and rock samples on Tuesday.

The rocks, taken from a crater left by the impact in the eastern part of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday, were not from the meteorite, but some could contain material left behind by the space body, commission member Wilfred Strauch told reporters at a press conference.

"Researchers will be collecting more samples of rocks and nearby trees" for analysis, Strauch said.

Strauch, who works for the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (Ineter), said researchers were seeking international help to figure out what caused the explosion on Sept. 6.

The Nicaraguan government announced on Sunday that a loud explosion that frightened residents could have come from a meteorite that fell near Managua's international airport. A crater measuring 12 meters across was left on the ground.

The incident coincided with the passing of a small asteroid, the 2014 RC, near the Earth on the same day.

Also on Tuesday, an expert with the U.S. space agency NASA, Don Yeomans, said it was unlikely that a piece of rock had separated from the asteroid as it whooshed past the Earth.

NASA experts also said the fact that no local residents reported seeing a fireball in the sky prior to the crash means it was not a meteorite.

Strauch said those observations were "very interesting and important," adding Nicaragua will invite experts from NASA and other countries, such as Uruguay, to spend a month investigations at the site.
