The FBI has allegedly interviewed a man whose video chat with a friend picked up audio of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown, the individual’s lawyer tells CNN. What attorney Lopa Blumenthal claims is the sound of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson firing at the unarmed 18-year-old can be heard in two distinct bursts — at least six shots, a pause, and an additional four shots, according to a forensic audio expert — in the ten-second clip.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” says a lawyer who has previously represented the family of a police shooting victim.

(The foreground of the audio is a bit distracting. “You are pretty. You’re so fine. Just going on some of your videos. Okay, yeah,” says a man’s voice. As CNN’s Don Lemon put it, “Your client, uh, was having a video chat. With a friend. Doing normal … whatever you do.”)

Brown’s friend Dorian Johnson, who witnessed the shooting, has said Brown was shot first while struggling with Officer Wilson, and then again after running away as he turned back with his hands up. However, “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well, I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again,’” offered CNN host and attorney Van Jones.

An autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family found that the teenager was shot at least six times, four times in the right arm and twice in the head, all in the front.
