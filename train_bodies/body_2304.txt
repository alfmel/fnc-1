Since sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 have increased significantly in recent years, the case has sparked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia.

"That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school," Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynecologist from Sarajevo, said, describing the growing trend as "worrying."

Apart from educational institutes, parents should also play a significant role in providing effective sex education, he said.

"It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences," he continued. "We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life."

According to the InSerba News Network, young girls in Bosnia are allegedly seeking advice from experts online. "I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged," one girl wrote online.

Since returning from the trip, all seven girls have reportedly dropped out of their classes, UK MailOnline reported.

Meanwhile, early engagement in sexual relations leads to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Last year in Sarajevo, 31 underage girls made headline after becoming pregnant.
