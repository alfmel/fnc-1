Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon after locals in the Indian city of Ganganagar heard a teenage girl’s screams from down an alley

A man accused of trying to rape a teenage girl is in a critical condition after locals hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver in a butcher shop.

After hearing terrified screams, an angry mob took the law into its own hands and dragged Suresh Kumar, 40, into a butchers in the city of Ganganagar, India.

He was found down an alley, pinning the terrified girl against a wall.

Following a community meeting, the vigilantes decided to drag him to a local butcher’s shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour, before chopping off his genitalia with a meat cleaver.

The remains were then dumped in the middle of the road with Kumar's bleeding body nearby.

Local Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: "No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

"We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

"This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished."

Police have called for those responsible to come forward.

A police spokesman said: "People cannot take the law into your own hands.

"As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

"We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.

The man was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl was treated for shock, and given counselling.
