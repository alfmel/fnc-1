Authorities say Bary has a similar accent to the man who beheaded US journalist James Foley.

British rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary has been identified as the killer of American journalist James Foley. Video of Foley’s beheading was released by ISIS last week.
FOX News reported:

American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abde Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley’s executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary’s Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with ISIS, the source said.

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as “The Beatles.”

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain’s two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages.
