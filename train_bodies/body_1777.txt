An article saying McDonald’s is removing the Big Mac, Apple Pies, and large size options isn’t real.

It was published on Daily Buzz Live, a fake news website.

According to a disclaimer, “Most are inspired by real news events, And just a few stories are works of complete fiction. Those few articles are for entertainment purposes only. The articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways. Therefore, just a few articles contained on this website Daily Buzz Live are works of fiction. Any truth or actual facts contained in those stories or posts are purely incidental or coincidental and not intended to be, or be construed as, facts.”

So while some of the articles are “real news,” this article about McDonald’s is fake.

Tens of thousands of people on Facebook shared the bogus article as of Sunday.

Here’s what the bogus article reads:

McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.”

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.
