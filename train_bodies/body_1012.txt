Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Greta Van Susteren tonight that ten ISIS fighters have crossed the border from Mexico into America.

Greta Van Susteren: You say theyâ€™re coming in the southern border which changes the dynamics. Do you have any information or any evidence that they are actually coming in the southern border now?

Rep. Hunter: Yes.

Greta: Tell me what you know?

Rep. Hunter: I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the southern border in Texas.

In September Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) also said four known terrorists were apprehended at the the US border in Texas and were still being held.
