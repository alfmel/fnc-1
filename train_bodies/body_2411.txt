A McDonald's burger bought 20 years ago has an uncanny resemblance to its modern day counterpart. Twenty years ago, opening statements in the OJ Simpson trial were being heard, a company called AOL rolled out Internet service, and two Aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local McD's. Two of those three things changed dramatically; one didn't, and in another 20 years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled, uber-preserved glory.

According to 9News.com out of Australia, friends Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, only 13 and 14 years old at the time, bought some burgers at an Adelaide McDonald's two decades ago. They ate their burgers, but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten.

No worries -- the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city. Either the friend never returned, or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke; either way, the teens turned into adults, but the burger refused to age.

"We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world," Dean said. "It started off as a joke, you know. We told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up, and before we knew it six months had passed."

Those months turned into years and now, 20 years later, the burger "looks the same as the day we bought it, perfectly preserved it its original packaging," Dean said.

The pair were featured on Australia's Channel 10 news, threatening to finally take a nosh. Even though it was for charity, the trustees of the burger just couldn't bring themselves to bite into it. Can you blame them? All of which begs the question: Exactly what is in a McDonald's burger that keeps it looking the same, 20 year later?
