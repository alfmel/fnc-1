James Wright Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in 2012, was beheaded in an ISIS video released on Tuesday, August 19.

The video is titled “A Message to America.”

A figure in a black robe with a gun strapped on his person and a masked hat covering his face, apart from his eyes, appears in the video next to Foley.

In the video, the Islamic State says that Obama’s authorization of strikes against IS places United States “upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” accordin to BNO.

“Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty & safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,” the ISIS person added.

Foley also speaks in the video, saying: “call on my friends, family members and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.”
