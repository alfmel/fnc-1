The alleged Vogue rat problem has metastasized into a rat king, if you believe Gawker's latest update. According to its source, the rats are basically holding a Friendsgiving in the fashion closet, nibbling away at shoe boxes, noshing on taffeta, and leaving droppings everywhere. (Sorry.) Per the report, it sounds like the staffers may be victims of their own highfalutin-design preferences; due to architectural changes requested by Anna Wintour and Cond√© Nast prior to the move-in date, the little suckers may have gotten in through the vents.
