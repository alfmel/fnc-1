Prepare to meet ... mite man.

Doctors removed a matchhead-sized insect, believed to be a spider, from under Dylan Thomas’s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is.

It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest, leaving a trail of red blisters.

The 21-year-old was on his first trip to Bali.

He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider “a bit bigger than the size of a match head” from his skin.

There’s just one problem.

Spiders, according to Perth arachnid expert Dr Volker Framenau, don’t burrow in skin.

“They don’t have the tools, the armature, to do this sort of stuff,” Dr Framenau said.

“I find it highly unlikely, almost impossible, that it was a spider.’

More likely, Dr Framenau said, was some kind of burrowing mite.

“That’s a professional skin-digger,” he said.

“There’s a lot of nasty stuff out there.”

The results of the tests on the creature should come back next week.

Mr Thomas has been contacted for comment.
