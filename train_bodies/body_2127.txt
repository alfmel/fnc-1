KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”
