Forget sweater weather and crisp autumn leaves; these days, the true arrival of fall seems marked by  the arrival of Starbucks' infamous pumpkin spice latte -- at least on the social media sphere.

This year, a rumor surfaced that the sticky sweet craze had spawned an entirely different pumpkin spice-flavored item: condoms, made by Durex.

The company did not immediately confirm or deny the existence of the product, leaving the Internet in a tizzy.

The plot thickened this morning, when Durex initially tweeted a denial but then deleted it, leading to further confusion. Finally, though, Durex put the rumors to rest: an unnamed company spokesperson told BuzzFeed that Durex would not be coming out with a pumpkin spice condom.

â€œDurex has heard that people are saying we launched a â€˜Pumpkin Spiceâ€™ condom," the spokesperson said. "We canâ€™t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom."

Even though pumpkin spice condoms proved to be a myth, the Internet still had a field day. Never forget.

I'm strangely disappointed that these pumpkin spice condoms aren't actually a thing. Because come on, pumpkin spice!

I guess we should all be thankful when our coworkers break out the pumpkin spice candles and not the pumpkin spice condoms

Durex now makes pumpkin spice condoms which means that no white girl is ever going to get pregnant again.

Don't need those pumpkin spice flavored condoms. I use natural birth control like wearing Crocs and cargo shorts.
