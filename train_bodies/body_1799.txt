Oliver Ilic mutilated himself after his girlfriend threw him over because of his abilities as a lover.

A Macedonian man hacked off his own manhood after being dumped for having bad bedroom skills.

Jilted lover Oliver Ilic reportedly tossed his member in the trash after slicing it off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

The 22-year-old lay bleeding on the floor of his Kocani home for several minutes before calling emergency services.

Cops arrived and found his severed organ in the waste paper bin. A bloodstained Ilic reportedly told officers that his small penis was to blame for his ruined relationship.

And so, feeling it was useless, he decided to cut it off.

He was rushed to a local medical center, but doctors struggled to re-attach his phallus.

Ilic was transferred to a hospital in the capital city Skopje, where it was sewed back on during a delicate five-hour operation.

Medics said it would be "some time" before they know if the surgery was a success and if the penis will ever function properly again.

It's the second time a Macedonian man has carried out such a masochistic act in recent years, The Austrian Times reports.

A 40-year-old reportedly cut off his member, but it could be not attached after he flushed it down his toilet.
