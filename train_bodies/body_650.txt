An Indian man had his penis cut off with a meat cleaver by a vigilante group, after attempting to rape a teenage girl.

The 40-year-old rapist, Suresh Kumar, was beaten with sticks for about an hour before his genitals was cut off.

The incident occurred in the city of Ganganagar, where Kumar was left bleeding as his penis and testicles lay on the road next to him.

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime. We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.”

The police, has however, urged those responsible for the castration to come forward and submit themselves for prosecution.

A police spokesman said, “People cannot take the law into your own hands. As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”
