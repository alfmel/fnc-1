Did you hear? It’s finally pumpkin spice season! (Don’t listen to the deniers.) And what better way to enjoy autumn than with a pumpkin-spice flavored condom?

At least that’s what social media would have you believe, as a photoshopped image of a limited-edition pumpkin-spice condom endlessly circulated on Twitter and Facebook over the weekend.

But alas, those hoping for a fall-flavored fling will have to keep wishing: On Monday, condom maker Durex announced on Twitter that the spice rumor is not right.

“We’ve heard talk that we launched a Pumpkin Spice condom. We can’t claim this one, but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.”

Sigh. Maybe next year.
