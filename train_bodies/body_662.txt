This is the moment the sleazy truth about a husband’s cheating ways was exposed to the world by his scorned wife.

Ting Su, 29, caught husband Cheng naked in an underground carpark in China along with her twin sister after tracking the pair down using a mobile tracking system.

When Su arrived on the scene to confront them, the surprised pair reacted to the bust and jumped out of the car.

Su seized the moment by taking some happy snaps before driving off, leaving the cheaters red-faced in the carpark.

“It was so funny. Loads of people were grabbing their phones and I did as well. He was banging his fist on the window and shouting at her, and she just wasn’t playing ball,” one witness said.

The Mirror reports that Cheng had been having an affair since Ting, who has now filed for divorce, gave birth to twins.
