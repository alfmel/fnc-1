Rep. Duncan Hunter said Border Patrol agents have captured ‘at least 10 ISIS fighters’ trying to enter the U.S. from Mexico. The California congressman’s bombshell on Fox News Tuesday also claims more militants may already be here.

ISIS may already be here.

In an alarmist bombshell statement that intersects both America’s war on terror and its fight to secure the border with Mexico, Rep. Duncan Hunter said ISIS fighters have been caught attempting to cross into the U.S.

Hunter, a California Republican and former Marine major, told Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday that Border Patrol agents have captured Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militants trying to get into Texas from Mexico.

“ISIS is coming across the southern border,” said Hunter, whose district includes much of San Diego. “They aren’t flying B-1 Bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

“At least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter continued. “There’s nobody taking about it.”

When Van Susteren pressed him for his source, the Congressman replied: “I’ve asked the Border Patrol.”

“They caught them at the border,” Hunter said. “Therefore, we know ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or 10 of them you know there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.”
