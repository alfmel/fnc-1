Two Australian men claim to have the oldest burger in the world - at a staggering 20 years old.

In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers.

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger. Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

“We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,” Mr Dean said.

“It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we’d hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

"The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.”

But the hardy burger is not the only long-lived Maccy D’s in existence.

The last McDonald's cheeseburger ever sold in Iceland is still going strong and mould-free – six years after it was bought by a burger-lover.

The fast-food giant shut up shop in Iceland in 2009 because it said the country's financial crisis had made it too expensive to operate.

The country had just three branches there – all in the capital Reykjavik.

Hjortur Smarason, 28, waited until the end of the last day when his local McDonald's closed – and made sure he purchased the very last cheeseburger together with a portion of fries.

The burger, which other than looking slightly shrivelled remains in remarkable condition, is now on display at the bar of a hostel in Reykjavik.
