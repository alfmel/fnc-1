Breitbart Texas has confirmed the existence of an Islamic tribunal in Texas that will make judgments in accordance with Sharia law.

The website for the Islamic tribunal states: “It is with this issue that Muslims here in America are obligated to find a way to solve conflicts and disputes according to the principles of Islamic Law and its legal heritage of fairness and justice in a manner that is reasonable and cost effective.”

The website states that Sharia’s well known criminal law, which includes things like cutting off hands of offenders, is only a portion of Sharia law. This tribunal would not do such things, but will focus on civil Sharia law rather than criminal Sharia law.

Breitbart Texas interviewed one of the tribunal’s “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. El-badawi said that the tribunal is done in accordance with Sharia as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” He also added that the tribunal is not arbitration. The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” instead of “arbitrators.” He said that the tribunal will resolve civil business and family disputes, as well as workplace disputes.

El-badawi was asked what would happen if there is conflict between the laws of Texas and Sharia law. He responded that the laws are in agreement most of the time, but said that Sharia would take precedence out of the two in the tribunal.

There are four judges listed on the tribunal’s website: Imam Yusuf Z.Kavakci, Imam Moujahed Bakhach, Imam Zia ul Haque Sheikh, and Dr. El-badawi.
