A man rushed to a Kansas City-area hospital Saturday is not being treated for Ebola, hospital officials say.

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of E. Meyer Blvd. was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

"Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary," Hamele said. "As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have."

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.
