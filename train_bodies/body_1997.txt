History buffs, start your engines: CNN is reporting that a Boston crew has removed a time capsule from the cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House, believed to have been stashed there by then-Governor Samuel Adams and patriot Paul Revere.

Inside the capsule are contents that will be showcased as soon as the box is removed from the cornerstone, according to Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin. The capsule, he explained to CNN, was documented to have been first buried in 1795, then was dug up and reburied in 1855 during repairs to the building. The full catalog of its contents are as-yet unknown.

"What we know the box contains, based on the notes that we have, is a Paul Revere plate, papers, and coins from the 1600s. It may contain other stuff too, we don't know that yet," he said. The Secretary of State's office is looking into whether the box will be reinstated and whether new items from the current era will be added to the box and reburied.

ABC News notes that the discovery is "the oldest unopened time capsule in the country."
