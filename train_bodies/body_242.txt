Sources are reporting that music legend Axl Rose, last remaining original member of the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame band Guns N' Roses, has been found dead at the age of 52.

Unconfirmed reports say Rose was found dead Tuesday late afternoon in his West Hollywood home after police were called around 3:30 pm for a welfare check.

A neighbor has confirmed the residence belongs to Rose but police have not confirmed the man's identity at this time.

"The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area. We have found no signs of abuse or foul-play and have turned the case over to the coroner's office to make a final ruling on the cause of death," said Ofc. William Tenpenny, a Hollywood Police spokesperson.

Born William Bruce Rose, Jr. on February 6, 1962, Rose has been named one of the greatest singers of all time by various media outlets, including Rolling Stone and NME.
