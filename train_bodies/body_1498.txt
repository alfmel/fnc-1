A prominent religious scholar in Saudi Arabia has reportedly issued a fatwa against building snowmen in the kingdom, stating the practice is not acceptable to Islam.

Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed said people must not build any snowmen or snow models of animals, according to Gulf News.

However, making snow models of lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings, was apparently acceptable in Islam, the scholar said.

"It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun," he reportedly said.

"God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on," he added.

No date was set for the implementation of the fatwa and there was no government comment. Any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa, but they have basis under Saudi law.

There was immediate reaction on social media to the story.

"It has no value in our traditions, and those who are fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture," one unnamed blogger said.

Another stated: "We have snow for fleeting days, maybe even hours, and there is always someone who wants to rob us of the joy and the fun. It seems that the only thing left for us is to sit down and drink coffee."

While Saudia Arabia is the second hottest country in the world, the kingdom has been hit by snowstorms this month, notably in the Tabuk region around 1000 kilometres northwest of the capital, Riyadh.
