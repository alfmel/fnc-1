Thirty-year-old Dimitry Nikolaev, a married Russian television actor, was having a drink at a bar in Moscow after a theater performance when an attractive, blonde woman approached him. The unidentified woman invited him to accompany her to a sauna where, according to police reports, they drank beer and kissed before he blacked out. 

The next morning, Dimitry woke up at a bus stop to find that his phone, wallet, and testicles had all been stolen. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors informed him that the procedure must have been done by someone with medical knowledge, as the surgery was done skillfully and his sack was carefully sewn up again following the removal of his nuts. Police therefore believe this was probably a result of organ trafficking, as opposed to a vindictive crime. 

Russian newspaper Life News reports that the actor is having trouble figuring out how to explain the situation to his wife, and for now is simply telling her he is at the hospital for a "serious illness." Though given that the story is all over the media, it's likely she's learned the truth by now.
