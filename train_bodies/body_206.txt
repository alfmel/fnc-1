Two U.S. officials say they believe American journalist James Foley was the victim executed by Islamic State militants as shown in a grisly video released Tuesday.

Separately, Foley's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a webpage that was created to rally support for his release.

In the statement, Foley's mother, Diane Foley, said the journalist, quote, "gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people."

One of the U.S. officials said President Barack Obama was expected to make a statement about the killing on Wednesday.

The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the video by name.
