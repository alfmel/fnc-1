Journalist Matt Taibbi is on a leave of absence from First Look Media after disagreements with executives, New York Magazine's Andrew Rice reports.

Taibbi is supposed to launch a publication this fall called Racket, focused on financial and political corruption. According to Rice, Taibbi has been absent for several weeks from the New York headquarters of e-Bay founder Pierre Omidyar's media company, which also hosts Glenn Greenwald's The Intercept. Omidyar hired Taibbi away from the Rolling Stone in February. 

"Taibbi's absence, the term of which is unknown, is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look," Rice reports. "Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused 'digital magazines.' In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism."

While the Intercept has been publishing regularly, Racket has been "slower to materialize,  leading to rumors of staff anxiety," Rice reports.

John Temple, president of audience and product at First Look Media, told Rice that he won't comment on personnel matters.
