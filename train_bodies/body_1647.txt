The TV presenter was filming a programme in the Queen's gardens when he came across the fungi, which has hallucinogenic properties

A species of magic mushroom has been found growing in the grounds of BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was astounded when he came across the funny fungi while filming a Christmas special at the Queen's London home - saying: "I won't be eating any of that."

The Amanita muscaria mushroom, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, is a white and red toadstool, with hallucinogenic properties.

The species contains poison which, in rare cases, can cause death if consumed.

Presenter Alan told The Sun he was surprised to happen upon the plants while working on The Queen's Garden, which will be screened on Christmas Day.

"That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are," he said.

Fly agaric are common and are understood to have grown naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there.

The hallucinogenic properties of the mushroom have been well-known for centuries and have a long history of use in religious and shamanistic rituals, according to the Kew Gardens website.

The fungi is also important to the growth and development of many types of tree, and provides food for flies, and a breeding site for beetles.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: "There are several hundred fungi species in the palace garden, including a small number of naturally occurring fly agaric mushrooms.

"As the programme explains, they are beneficial to trees, increasing their ability to take in nutrients."

Royal officials also made clear for the record that fungi from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens.
