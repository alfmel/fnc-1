The British Islamic State militant known as "Jihadi John" believed to be responsible for multiple executions of Western hostages has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi by a report in The Washington Post.

Born in Kuwait, Emwazi comes from a "well-to-do family" in West London and studied computer science at the University of Westminster.

The Post talked to multiple friends of Emwazi's who identified him as the jihadist militant responsible for the graphic beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and others. Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed "Jihadi John" by the media.

Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, once in Tanzania and again in Britain. This first detention frustrated Emwazi, according to one friend, who said, "Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated." When it happened again, the friend said, Emwazi wrote to the friend that he felt "like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London."

Emwazi is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012, where he became responsible for guarding prisoners for Islamic State, the militant Jihadist group also known as ISIS or ISIL that now controls large swathes of the country and Iraq. The BBC reports that British security services have previously chosen not to disclose Emwazi's name for "operational reasons."
