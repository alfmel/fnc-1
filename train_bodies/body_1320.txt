A photograph has emerged of what appears to be a penis-shaped graffiti picture drawn on a Â£1.5million Bugatti Veyron.

The image - which is thought to have been taken in Seattle - prompted a mixed response from online users after it was posted on Reddit this week, with some appearing to revel in the crude drawing.

One person said; "The spray paint is almost an improvement", while another wrote; "If you can afford a Bugatti, you can afford to park it in a secure lot."

But others condemned the graffiti artist for vandalism.

A Reddit user said: "This hurts me to look at. You never f*** with someone's vehicle."

Another posted: "That's not a prank. That's vandalism and destruction of property."

The identity of the car owner remains unknown and it was not immediately clear if anyone had been arrested for vandalism of the vehicle.
