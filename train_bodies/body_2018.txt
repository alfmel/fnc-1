Kim Jong-un has been guzzling litres of rare snake wine to perk up his love life with wife, it has been reported.

The cases of the pricey plonk with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle were delivered at the supreme leader's palace in North Korea, the Daily Star reported.

Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improve the size of their manhood.

The 31-year-old despot, and his wife Ri Jol-su, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight.

The ruler's waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky.

Sources revealed that the elite in the country joke that Jong-un is now too big to please his wife and that's why they do not have any other children.
