When Oliver Ilic's girlfriend broke up with him and told him he's not very good in bed, he had an extreme post-breakup reaction and chopped off his penis. Yikes.

He told doctors that his girlfriend had complained about the size of his manhood, which led to him grabbing a razor blade and mutilating himself.

But when the bleeding wouldn't stop, Ilic knew it was time to get some help, so he called emergency services and was taken away in an ambulance. Police discovered the severed organ sitting in the bin, and one five-hour operation later, the penis was reattached.

However, doctors say it's still too early to tell if the surgery was a success, and it remains to be seen if Ilic will regain full use of the organ.

We're just glad to hear that Ilic is on the road to recovery - he must have felt truly traumatised to harm himself in such a way.
