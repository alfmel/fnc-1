Macaulay Culkin is NOT dead. A “breaking news” story claiming, “Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34″ is a 100 percent fake hoax that’s gone viral on Facebook and Twitter. It is NOT true.

The rumor has been fueled by what looks like a screenshot from a cable news broadcast with the graphic, “Breaking: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead At Age 34″ (see below), which has been shared more than 700,000 times on Facebook. Additionally, at least one version of the “dead” story appears on a MSNBC.website URL meant to trick people into thinking they’re reading the real MSNBC.

According to the FAKE story, “Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34. Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.”

Most people just read the headline and immediately spread the “news” that Culkin was allegedly dead, panicking other fans on social media and compounding the problem. Culkin is alive and well. He’s just the latest celebrity to be victimized by a death hoax.
