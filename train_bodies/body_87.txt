Vogue's downtown migration to One World Trade Center was documented with military precision on Instagram. Models pitched in (though it must have been tough to get much done in a floor-length gown). Will.i.am helped schlep boxes, for some reason. Now the magazine is firmly established downtown, and amid the helicopter-assisted sunset vistas, it appears that there may also be a less picturesque facet to the new digs. Gawker is reporting that the offices are #blessed with a rat infestation. According to one of their sources, Anna Wintour has decreed that the staff "must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it." Glamorous!
