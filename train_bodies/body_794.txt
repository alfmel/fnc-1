Say it 'aint so!
Last week we told you about a YouTube prank that saw a homeless man get $100, only to turn around and spend the money on his peers.
However, we're hearing reports that Josh Paler Lin's inspiring video may be nothing more than a well-filmed prank!
Apparently, an eyewitness named Taugan Tan Kadalim claims he saw Josh and Thomas, the homeless man, in a car together outside of the liquor store in the video.

26-year-old Taugan says that he recognized Josh from his YouTube videos and wanted to stay to see what pranks he was going to get up to.
Well, instead of a prank, he says that Josh and Thomas were working together and that Thomas knew he was being videotaped.
We're not so sure that the video isn't real, mostly because it's so heartwarming that we don't want to think otherwise! Plus, the clip has raised more than $130,000 for homeless people, so it's doing some good whether it's real or not.
But what do you think??
Ch-ch-check out the video (below) and let us know in the comments if you think it's legit or if it's just a ploy to get famous!
