A woman at Dulles Airport was recently spotted wearing what appears to be a rain poncho, medical gloves and a protective mask.
The Daily Caller described the getup as a "hazmat suit," which is generous. The outlet also does not know exactly why the woman was wearing the protective gear, but the guess begins with the letter "E" and ends with "Bola."

Dulles is one of five U.S. airports that has implemented "enhanced screenings" for travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas and later died, passed through the Virginia airport on his way from Liberia to Dallas. Two nurses who treated Duncan have fallen ill with the disease, including one who flew commercially on Frontier Airlines.
According to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, between 15 and 55 passengers travel from West African countries plagued by the disease to Dulles everyday.
