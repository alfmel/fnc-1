It was less than two weeks ago that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin was gushing over Christian Bale as the best actor on the board in a certain age range” and his ideal choice to play Apple founder Steve Jobs in a new biopic. He said he “couldn’t be more excited” to have cast him in the role. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale has dropped out of the project.

Sources told THR that “after much deliberation and conflicting feelings” Bale “came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.” Before Bale was given the chance to turn down the role, it was reportedly offered to Leonardo DiCaprio, who also declined.

Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Seth Rogen is set to play Jobs’ co-founder Steve Wozniak. But without a signed deal with producer Scott Rudin, that casting could definitely change as well.

With Bale and DiCaprio out of the picture, what appropriately-aged, Oscar-calibar actor who looks enough like Steve Jobs could be left? And whatever you do, don’t say Ashton Kutcher.
