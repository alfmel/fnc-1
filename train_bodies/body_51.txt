A Kansas City TV station, KCTV-5 reported Saturday night someone was being quarantined at Rockhill Research Hospital (Research Medical Center), according to their sister station in Wichita, KWCH.

A source in Kansas City confirmed the story to the Gateway Pundit and added some details.

A Nigerian woman was taken to the hospital with a high fever and Ebola like symptoms. Her apartment building was quarantined, though that may have been lifted later.

The source added the Nigerian woman initially tested negative for Ebola and was released (or set to be released) but was called back to the hospital. The source said parts of the hospital may be quarantined but the hospital is not confirming anything.

The CDC is reportedly on the way, according to the source.
