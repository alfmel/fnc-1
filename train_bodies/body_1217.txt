From Batman to technology pioneer, Oscar-winning actor Christian Bale is reportedly in “late talks” to play Steve Jobs in Sony Pictures’ upcoming biopic about the Apple co-founder’s life, Variety reports.

If Variety is correct, not only will the film have Bale, who has played Moses in Ridley Scott’s biblical film and Batman in the “Dark Knight” trilogy, it will also have a director and screenwriter with an Academy Award under his belt. Aaron Sorkin won an Oscar in 2011 for writing “The Social Network,” the 2010 film about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s humble start in 2003. (RELATED: First Full Trailer For ‘Exodus’ Is Intense)

Sorkin has said before that he plans for the film to be divided into three scenes, mainly.

“The first one being the Mac. The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.”

Variety’s sources said Bale would likely shoot the film in spring of 2015.
