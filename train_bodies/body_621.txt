A Sept. 8 U.S. Department of Defense news article talking about the success of airstrikes in Iraq mentions a question from the media — and answer — about the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

From the article:

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

And an article by The Associated Press on The Gazette’s website says U.S. President Barack Obama will address his nation Wednesday night to outline plans for an expanded U.S. effort to confront ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
