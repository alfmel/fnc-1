Christian Bale will star as late Apple CEO Steve Jobs in the upcoming biopic from director Danny Boyle. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed the decision in an upcoming interview with Bloomberg Television today, adding that the Oscar-winning actor didn't even have to audition for the role.

"We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that’s Chris Bale," Sorkin said. "He didn’t have to audition. Well, there was a meeting."



Bale was among the actors reported to be in contention for the lead role, along with Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The still-unnamed film is based on Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography about Jobs, and shooting will begin within the next couple of months. Sorkin, best known for his writing on The West Wing and The Social Network, says Bale will have a lot of work to do on set, though he's confident in his abilities.

"He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined," he told Bloomberg. "There isn’t a scene or a frame that he’s not in. So it’s an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it."
