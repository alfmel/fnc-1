Curvy Lucita Sandoval, 26, has been accused on several occasions of romping with students but until now nothing had been proven.

In the explicit video the teen is seen grinning wildly and giving the camera a thumbs up before panning around to show he is having sex with his teacher.

The boy, who has not been identified, allegedly told Sandoval he had deleted the video.

But instead he shared the 23-minute-long clip with friends on WhatsApp after which it quickly went viral.

School officials in the city of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, have said now there is clear proof of Sandoval's abuse they will be forced to act.

The 26-year-old brunette has yet to comment on the scandal.
