American fears may be realized. One of the five Taliban members released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is believed to have returned to militant activity in Qatar.

CNN’s Barbara Starr reported Thursday that one of the Taliban Five may have reverted back to terrorism. Over the last few months, one of the men released has reached out to militants. The administration now suspects that he may again be a threat.

The White House was already facing renewed criticism for the deal made this summer. Many experts criticized the plan, saying it set a precedent to negotiate and exchange prisoners with terrorist groups.

The government of Jordan has indicated that it is willing to trade attempted suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi for Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

This week, NBC reported that the Pentagon will charge Bergdahl with desertion although no charges have been made yet.

Obama brought Bergdahl and his mother on June 1, 2014, to the Rose Garden to promote the deal that brought the soldier home. The slew of news surrounding the transfer vindicates those skeptical of the deal that the White House made without notifying Congress, as required by law.

At every turn, this decision has proven to be a bad deal for America’s security.
