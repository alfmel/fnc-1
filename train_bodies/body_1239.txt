LAS VEGAS, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Vice's Shane Smith got lucky in Las Vegas over the weekend and spent the money on a $300,000 steak dinner at the Bellagio.

Bloomberg originally reported the story 12 unidentified guests racking up the large dinner tab. One guest said the party reached 25 people.

Vice has received some negative attention for its low pay for journalists and producers but the company maintains they offer vacation, health benefits and stock options. Smith reportedly gave $1 million to staff at the Christmas party last year.

New York Times journalist David Carr, who recently died, mentioned seeing Smith at the Casino on his Twitter in early January.
