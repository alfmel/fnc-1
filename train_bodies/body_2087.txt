Gorging on comfort food is pretty much a given when dealing with a breakup, but one woman decided to take her heartbreak public by camping out at a local KFC for seven days.

After being dumped by her boyfriend, Tan Shen says she was walking the city feeling depressed when she decided to stop into a KFC outlet in a train station in Chengdu China, reports Metro UK.

After ordering some chicken wings, Shen realized going back to her apartment would be too difficult.

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think,” Shen said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

Luckily for Shen, the place where she camped out is open for 24 hours. At first, the lovesick woman went unnoticed by employees since they work in different shifts.

"At first no one really noticed her. But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realized we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left,” Jiang Li Lung, a KFC employee said.

Shen ordered more wings and fries and continued to stay in her booth. After a week, local media reportedly started flocking to the restaurant so Shen decided it was time to leave.

"I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving,” Shen said.

But her best line ever?

"And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore."

Ah, the woes of the heartbroken.
