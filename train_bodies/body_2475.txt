We reported on Monday that a meteor, thought possibly to be a chunk of an Earth-passing asteroid, was the cause of a 40-foot crater outside the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital.

But astronomers and NASA scientists are now casting doubt on that possibility. The biggest mystery is that no one so far has reported seeing a flash of light in the sky that would be expected to accompany such a meteor strike.

"While a meteoritic origin for this crater cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty, the information available at this time suggests that some other cause is responsible for its creation," NASA's blog concludes.

It's a sentiment echoed by Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Territorial Studies, or Ineter, who concluded that it's "very strange that no one reported a streak of light.

"We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something," he said.

It also appears that a meteor landing in Nicaragua could not have come from asteroid 2014 RC, also nicknamed "Pitbull," as first thought. National Geographic writes:
