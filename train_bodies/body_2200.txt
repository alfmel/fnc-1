A video released by the Islamic State on Tuesday allegedly shows a stray weapons bundle from the United States that missed its target in Kurdish-controlled areas near Kobani, Syria and instead fell into the hands of IS (ISIS or ISIL) militants.

Sunday evening, the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. military had conducted a weapons drop to supply Syrian Kurds fighting IS militants in Kobani with small arms and supplies.

Pentagon Spokesperson Rear Adm. John Kirby also confirmed Monday that one of the bundles had missed its target, but that it had been destroyed so that “ISIL terrorists couldn’t get to it.”

The video, released by unofficial IS news agency Aamaq, bears the Arabic title: “Arms and ammunition delivered by American planes fell in areas controlled by the Islamic State in Kobani.”

The video shows an IS militant rifling through the weapons and supplies, which include grenades, explosive canisters, and RPG rounds.

“Thank God, the Mujahideen have them now,” the masked militant said.

Here is the full video:
