First lady Michelle Obama’s face was reportedly blurred by Saudi state television Tuesday as she and the president met with new Saudi King Salman in Riyadh.

The new Saudi king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but did not acknowledge the first lady at all during a brief aside at the funeral for King Abdullah, Bloomberg View reported.

Mrs. Obama did not wear a head scarf during the funeral, as is custom for any woman appearing in public in Saudi Arabia. Visitors to the kingdom are not required to abide by its strict dress code, but the first lady was still criticized on social media by Saudis using the hashtags #Michelle_Obama_Immodest and #Michelle_Obama_NotVeiled, Politico reported.

Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without censoring Mrs. Obama’s face, Bloomberg reported.

The president and first lady cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral Tuesday. Mr. Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah’s vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world,” Bloomberg reported.
