Macaulay Culkin is not dead. The actor is just next victim in a long line of Hollywood death hoaxes.

The rumor started when a Facebook page was made to memorialize the actor.

"At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page," read the post on Facebook.

A fake news report also claimed that the "Home Alone" star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. Fortunately, none of this is true. 

The actor's representatives issued a statement about the hoax.

"He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and, well, stop believing what you see on the Internet." 

This is not the first death hoax aimed at the actor. Back in April, rumors spread that Culkin was found dead.

Culkin is currently a member of rock band Pizza Underground. The band covers Velvet Underground songs with pizza-themed lyrics.
