Police will stop arresting people for low-level possession of marijuana and will instead simply issue a summons, sources said.

The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio are prepared to initiate a change in policy that would drastically reduce the number of arrests for possession of pot, according to law-enforcement sources.

The department had already been halting its pot “buy and bust” operations, a crime-fighting staple that often led to gun seizures and arrests for outstanding warrants, The Post had earlier reported.

Sources said that the “powers that be,” including City Hall, wanted to see a decrease in arrests for pot because they have “disastrous consequences’’ on police relations with minorities.

Blacks and Hispanics have accounted for 86 percent of low-level pot busts this year, according to the Marijuana Research Project.

At a press conference scheduled for Monday, de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton are expected to announce the key aspects of the policy change.

They will also likely spell out such details as how much marijuana will be considered low-level.

De Blasio plans to meet with the city’s five district attorneys this week, according to The New York Times, and Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson has already expressed disapproval at policy change.

Thompson has curbed prosecution of low-level possession of marijuana in his borough, and his office has already dismissed many misdemeanor marijuana cases.

Earlier this month, the head of each borough’s narcotics unit was summoned to 1 Police Plaza and told to shift their attention to more potent drugs.
