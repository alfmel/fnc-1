Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, “Spring Forward,” is an apt time reference.

Suva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. A flurry of fashionable accessories including various colors and materials (plastic, leather, and metal, including high-end metals such as gold, silver and platinum), starting at $29 and ranging over several hundred dollars. We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use). Purchase locations to be Apple retail stores and Apple online store only. Hundreds of applications immediately available upon release, ranging from social, financial, health, sports and news etc.

Apple is more likely to benefit from continued iPhone 6 sales, Suva opines. Still, the WTch is among things that expand its addressable market:

We do note Apple is actively expanding its total available market (watches, payments, automotive etc). We expect Apple to sell 3.1M watch units in the June qtr, with a F12M est of 17.1M watch units.

Apple stock on Thursday closed up $1.62, or 1.3%, at $130.41.
