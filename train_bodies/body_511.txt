The leaked video of Georgy Myakinkin's protest against heavy-handed security guards at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia, has gone viral

This is the moment an airport worker protested against 'rough' security guards - by stripping NAKED and walking through the scanner in just his socks.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, left his keys at work following his shift at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia.

When he returned to collect them, he says "heavy-handed" security guards stopped him 'unnecessarily' and told him he had to remove his belt.

Staging an impromptu protest, he then stripped naked - apart from his socks - before sauntering through the scanner, leaving the guards gobsmacked.

He said: "I returned to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner.

"I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict - security guards were just being heavy-handed.

"When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police."

Georgy whipped off his clothes and walked through the scanner. The speechless officers then allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day, he discovered that the CCTV security camera video had been leaked and gone viral.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

A spokesman said: "We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment."

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video.

He said: "I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh."
