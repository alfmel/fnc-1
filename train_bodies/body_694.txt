UNCONFIRMED reports indicate a US journalist held captive in Iraq has been beheaded as a “message” to President Obama to end air strikes.
Video and pictures of journalist James Wright Foley’s final moments have been published via Twitter by accounts claiming to be associated with the Islamic State, previously known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Mr Foley was abducted in Idlib, Iraq, in 2012. Born in New Hampshire, he wrote for a variety of media organisations including the Global Post.
The identity of the man in the high-definition footage, titled “A Message to America”, has not yet been confirmed.
The footage shows a man in orange prisoner fatigues being led to a remote desert location where he is forced to kneel before reciting a message ... stating that his “real killer” was the United States.
He is then beheaded.
The Islamic State has issued a warning with the video: There will be more executions if President Barak Obama does not end air strikes in aid of the embaddled Kurdish and Iraqi Government forces.
“We will drown all of you in blood,” a statement attributed to the Jihadists states.
The video then shows what it claims to be another US captive.
