A uniformed soldier was shot at the Canadian War Memorial on Wednesday morning by a gunman dressed in dark clothing who fled toward Parliament Hill.

There have been unconfirmed reports of more shootings inside Centre Block, and Parliament Hill is in lockdown mode. Police and emergency vehicles filled the parking area in front of the Hill.

The shooting, which has been confirmed by Ottawa police, occurred just before 10 a.m. Bystanders and paramedics were giving emergency medical attention to the downed soldier, who was lying on the ground in front of the Cenotaph.

Witnesses described seeing a man running from the scene as tall with a dark coat.

The shooting comes just two days after two soldiers were run down by a car near a recruiting centre near Montreal. One soldier was killed in that incident.

More to come.
