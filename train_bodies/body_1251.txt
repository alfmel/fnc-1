The lethal animals are being launched at Iraqi residents by the jihadist fighters.

IS, which has taken control over large areas of Iraq and Syria, are using the bombs to target civilians in the north of the country.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, told the Mirror: "They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

"Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

"Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear."

The news comes as an IS fighter took to Twitter to laugh at the victims of the deadly Sydney siege.

Former Sydney resident Mohamed Elomar, who was pictured holding up the severed heads of two dead soldiers earlier this year, posted two sick tweets following the attack.

After referencing the 2011 Mumbai terror attacks he then posted: "I think we got ourselves a real life hostage situation in Sydney lolololololololo."

Another Islamist posted on Twitter: "The world must stand for the news of 13 Australians but it would sleep for the news of over 130,000 Muslims killed in Syria.

"Gaza is under siege, Homs and Damascus are under siege the CAFE in Sydney is Not. The Hash rage SydneySiege is a joke."
