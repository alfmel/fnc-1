Welsh actor Christian Bale has withdrawn from the role of Steve Jobs in a forthcoming biopic of the Apple entrepreneur. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale decided he "was not right for the part after much deliberation and conflicting feelings."

The as-yet-untitled biopic, which is coming out of Sony's studios, has been written by The Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin and will be directed by Danny Boyle. In mid-October, Sorkin announced Bale's involvement in a TV interview, explaining that the Batman actor didn't even need to audition.

Sorkin explained he had high hopes for Bale: "There isn't a scene or a frame that he's not in. So it's an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it."

The Sony film has been in progress since 2012 and was due to start filming this winter, after former director David Fincher dropped out of the project in April over a pay dispute.

Boyle is in LA this week to meet with the potential cast. Seth Rogen is said to be in discussions to play Jobs' colleague and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, but no official announcments have been made.
