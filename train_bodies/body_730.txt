Glenn Beck on Wednesday expressed fear that the 11 jets reportedly seized by radical Islamist groups in Libya over the past month could be used to cause extraordinary damage to the United States, even if the jets never leave the Middle East.

How? Extremists could crash the planes into the oil fields in any of the oil-rich countries on which the U.S. is dependent.
Beck was speaking with Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) about the jets when Bachmann remarked: “There’s really two concerns. One, the planes could be used in a similar way that they were used on 9/11 in the United States. They could be used as, essentially, flying bombs — into oil fields, buildings or strategic targets. Number two, [a] plane could be loaded with terrorists, could land as a commercial aircraft in an American city somewhere, or a European city. [They could] deplane, go about, carry out maybe a Mumbai-type disaster. So there’s multiple ways these planes could be used.”

“Oil fields,” Beck repeated. “The thing you said that feels the most true to me is the oil fields. … We’ll know what airplane — that’s one of those missing airplanes — but you could take off in Libya and be over the skies of Saudi Arabia in lightning speed, and just crash it.”

Bachmann said that with some routes, if a flight to Saudi Arabia deviates from its course, the Saudis only have 90 seconds to neutralize the threat before it could cause tremendous harm.

“It’s very little time that they have,” she said.
