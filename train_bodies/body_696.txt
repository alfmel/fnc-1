Last night, @FoxNewsPress, the Twitter account claiming to be that of the Fox News public relations team, went live. One big problem: It’s a fake.

They had one mission, they declared:

The team at @FoxNews have set up this account to manage and dispel all false facts attributed to us through the #foxnewsfacts trend. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

The hashtag refers to a meme that blew up after a Fox contributor declared that certain British cities had been swallowed whole by Muslim immigrants. “In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in,” said Steve Emerson, whose statement was so absurd that it was actually debunked by British PM David Cameron himself. (For the record, Birmingham’s Christian population is twice the size of the Muslim population.)

And so, @FoxNewsPress went about trying to stop people from mocking Fox News, with the power of empty legal threats:

@ScottMacBain we have no record of this in our news lists. Please delete tweet or face legal charges. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

And the faker responded with anger:

@Victorialush this false statement is not from our news list. Please delete or face legal action. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

Fox News confirmed to Mediaite on Monday that this account is, in fact, a fake.

Though that likely won’t stop the fraudulent tweeters from issuing an empty lawsuit threat against us, like they did to the Washington Examiner:

We have been made aware that individuals posing as ourselves have been quoted by @dcexaminer. We will be pursuing legal recourse for mis… — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

representation and requesting the article is removed from publication. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015
