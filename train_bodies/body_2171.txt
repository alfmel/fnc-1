Over the weekend, Reddit user fryd_ posted a letter that Lego included in boxes of its toy building bricks in the 1970s. Addressed to parents, the note has a message about gender equality and gendered children's products that many toy companies today still don't seem to understand.

The letter reads:

To Parents. The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls. It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship. A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses. The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The Reddit user told Buzzfeed that he found the note while playing with Legos with his niece and nephew at their grandmother's house. "It struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago," he said, adding, "I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!"

This letter's message is consistent with the gender-neutral Lego ad from 1981 that made the Internet rounds back in February. The creator of the ad, Judy Lotas, told The Huffington Post, "Boys and girls are different, but not to the exclusion of wanting to create and build. That’s not a gender issue."

Hear, hear!
