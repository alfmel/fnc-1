What happened to an Australian man this past week is usually the stuff of nightmares for arachnophobes.

Dylan Thomas, of Bunburry, Australia, woke up to a strange mark on his stomach while he vacationed in Bali.

According to an interview with his local paper, the Bunbury Mail, Thomas said the mark continued to grow up his abdomen, and he started to feel a "burning sensation like a searing feeling."

On Monday, Oct. 13, a dermatologist at Bali International Medical Centre determined the source of the mark. A tropical spider had buried itself under his skin through an old appendix scar.

According to the Bunbury Mail, the spider was dead when it was removed.
