A delivery guy in Ann Arbor, Michigan, received a tip of $2,084 Thursday, when he delivered a single pizza to a conference of real estate agents.

Brian LeFevre, delivery manager at Ann Arbor’s Pizza House, told the AP that Rob was “ecstatic” with his big tip.

“That’s a pretty good day’s work” for just one pizza, LeFevre said.

“All I did was deliver pizza,” the bewildered but grateful Rob can be heard saying in this video:
