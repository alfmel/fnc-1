Police in the Mexican town of Iguala have found mass graves near the same place where 43 students went missing last month.

The Mexican newspaper El Proceso says authorities have begun digging up bodies and are trying to determine their identities.

The Wall Street Journal quotes Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco as saying the graves were linked to the disappearance of the students but that it would "irresponsible" to jump to conclusions and say the bodies are those of the students.

The Journal adds:

The AP reports that the The Aytozinapa Normal school, where the missing students attended, is "known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks."

The AFP reports that Governor Angel Aguirre appealed for calm.

"I call on all [Guerrero state residents] to maintain harmony, non-confrontation, and avoid violence," he said.

El Universal reports that family members and other students reacted to the news violently, "launching 10 molotov cocktails and flipping a car."
