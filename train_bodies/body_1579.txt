BUNBURY, Australia, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- A West Australian man who developed a mysterious mark on his skin during a trip to Bali said doctors found a tropical spider had burrowed under his skin.
Dylan Thomas said he first noticed the mark on his stomach during his trip to the Indonesian island Saturday and he visited a doctor Sunday when he noticed the wound growing and producing a burning sensation.



The doctor told Thomas he had been bitten by an insect and gave him some antihistamines.

However, Thomas said the wound continued to worsen Monday and he went to a hospital, where a dermatology specialist identified the problem.

"Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily," Thomas posted on Facebook.



The spider was dead when the doctor removed it with tweezers. Hospital staff said the spider had burrowed in through Thomas' appendix scar and crawled under his skin to the man's sternum.

Thomas said he is hoping his ordeal will inspire his friends to ship in money for him to get a giant spider tattooed across his chest in the style of Spider-Man's costume.
