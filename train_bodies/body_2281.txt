Eyewitnesses said an armed man with long black hair emerged at the war memorial, fired about four times‎, and a guard went down. The gunman then ran toward Parliament Hill. The shooting victim was taken to hospital in an ambulance. Police have sealed off the area.

Police locked down Parliament and Ottawa Police tactical officers arrived, pointing guns at journalists and ordering them to the ground. Journalists were put into lockdown at the foyer in front of the House of Commons. Police were warning the public to stay away from Parliament Hill and the war memorial.

Reporters saw a body lying on the floor outside the Library of Parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper “is safe and has left Parliament Hill,” Jason MacDonald, his director of communications, said via Twitter.

Amid the chaos, MPs were among those taking cover. Michelle Rempel, a Conservative MP from Calgary, used Twitter to communicate with the outside world: “Mom im okay Im in hiding.” She also tweeted: “is it clear people? shots were outside caucus room”.

It appears that officers were searching the building. One body was visible outside the library of parliament, roughly in the middle of Centre Block, but it was unclear if that was a suspect or a law enforcement official.
