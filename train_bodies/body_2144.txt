In a video released late Friday night, the leader of Islamist militant group Boko Haram claimed Nigeria's kidnapped schoolgirls have all been converted to Islam and married off.

In the video, obtained by Agence France-Presse, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau also denied having agreed to a ceasefire with the Nigerian government.

"Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam? They have now memorized two chapters of the Koran," he said.

Laughing, he dashed hope that a deal might be reached in exchange for the girls' release, saying, "The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off."
