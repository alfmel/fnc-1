In a welcome break from a slow weekend of news filled with violence and murders, a report that actor Judd Nelson—best known for playing "The Criminal" John Bender in The Breakfast Club—had died turned out to be false.
The false report came from the site "foxnews.es" which somehow manages to beat the real FOX News in reporting fake information. Nelson's agent Gregg Klein denied the report to the LA Times today and even provided a photo of the alive-and-well "Brat Pack" actor holding up a copy of today's Sunday Times with the note, "Reports of Judd Nelson's death are not accurate please see attached photo."
The phony report mentions that Nelson died last night in his condo at the Sierra Towers in West Hollywood. Nelson does not live in that building, according to Klein.
With John Bender alive and well, let us enjoy this montage of his best moments in The Breakfast Club:
