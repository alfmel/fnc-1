Just when you thought the iPhone 6 saga—think "Bendgate" and fake Apple ads that led to microwave fires—couldn't possibly get worse, users are now saying the phone is causing them to lose hair, literally.

Some iPhone 6 owners reported getting their hair snagged when holding the phone to their face, and they claim that the seam between the aluminium and glass screen is catching hairs and tearing them out, the Daily Mail reported earlier this week.

Twitter users have been posting about the tearouts under the hashtags beardgate, seamgate and hairgate.

Last month after Apple reported record sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, users took to social media to discuss "BendGate," the term used to describe the claims that iPhones may bend or become warped when carried in trouser pockets.

Apple responded to reports by saying it only received nine complaints about bending phones and has tested 15,000 of them.

Separately, a fake advertisement claiming Apple iOS8 users could wirelessly charge their iPhones by placing it in the microwave went viral after users who fell for the scam ruined their devices.
