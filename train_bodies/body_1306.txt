Ahmed Abdi Godane was the 'principal target' of the Monday attack.

A U.S. airstrike killed the leader of a Somali terrorist group Monday, the Pentagon confirmed Friday.

Al Shabab head Ahmed Abdi Godane — who was considered one of the world's most wanted men — was the 'the principal target' of the attack, officials said Tuesday when they announced the strike.

The Pentagon knew immediately that six people were killed in the Monday strike, but Godane was not identified as a victim until Friday.

The other five victims have not been identified.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, was the reviled leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated group. The State Department desperately wanted to find him and had put a $7 million bounty on his head.

His death deals a major blow to the Somali terror network, the Pentagon said.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Defense Department’s chief spokesman, said the drone and aircraft attack directly targeted the terrorists.

Six people, including Godane, were killed. The other five victims have not been named.

In the strike, missiles destroyed a suspected terrorist compound near the port city of Barawe, a stronghold of the group. The missiles hit Godane as he left a meeting of the group's top leaders.

President Barack Obama said airstrike was highly calculated and well planned.

“That deliberation allows us to do it right,” he said at a Friday press conference.

The airstrike against Al Shabab is part of the U.S.’s larger anti-terrorism campaign. Troops have previously launched strikes against ISIS terrorists in Iraq.

“The goal has to be dismantle them,” Obama said of ISIS, Al Shabab and other terrorist organizations.
