Six-time MLB All-Star Jose Canseco shot himself in the hand on Tuesday afternoon at his Las Vegas residence and is recovering at a hospital in the area.

Spencer Lubitz of KTNV in Las Vegas added specifics about Canseco's condition:


Natalie Cullen of CBS 8 News Now got confirmation through police that an accidental shooting had occurred at Canseco's home.

Canseco, 50, enjoyed many of the best years of his career with the Oakland Athletics, winning an American League MVP award in 1988 and his first of two World Series titles in 1989.

The slugger hit 462 total home runs, but discredited the power element of his game to a degree in publicly admitting to extensive steroid use.
