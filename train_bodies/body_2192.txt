WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: "It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

"The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

"Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

"Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency."

The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a way of raising overseas cash.
