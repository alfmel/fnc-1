Former Major League Baseball outfielder Jose Canseco was injured in an accidental shooting at his home in Las Vegas, Nev., according to KLAS-TV's Natalie Cullen.

Canseco allegedly shot himself in the hand and is now recovering at a local hospital, reports KTNV's Spencer Lubitz. Police have confirmed that a shooting took place at Canseco's home on the east side of the Las Vegas valley, per the KLAS-TV story.

In 17 major league seasons, Canseco hit .266/.353/.515 with 462 home runs for seven teams including the Athletics, with whom he broke into the league as a 20-year-old slugger in 1985. Since his final MLB season in 2001, Canseco has attempted to remain in the spotlight by playing in various independent leagues, appearing on reality television shows and writing a book that detailed his and other players' performance-enhancing drug use. Canseco has also participated professionally in mixed martial arts, owning an 0-1 record.
