Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman, who ISIS had claimed to have abducted, posted on Facebook Monday afternoon that she was “safe and secure.” On Sunday, contributors to a number of jihadist platforms had claimed that the Islamic State group had captured a “female Zionist soldier fighting with the Kurds against the Islamic State” from Kobani.

International Business Times was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.

Rosenberg, 31, who migrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, is believed to have served for two years in the Israeli military, according to a report by Haaretz. She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

"This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. "We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria."

The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said.
