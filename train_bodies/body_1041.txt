First there was Bendgate. Then Gapgate. And now, the latest "gate" to attack smartphones — particularly the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus? Hairgate.

Apparently, some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners are getting strands of hair caught between the screen and the aluminum frame of the iPhone. And thus, Hairgate.

The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out. #seamgate— Paul Peavler (@CardMeHD) September 28, 2014

My own hair is quite long and I haven't had any strands get caught within the frame of my iPhone 6. Still, we wanted to put Hairgate to the test. You know, for science.

At least in our experiences, Hairgate is a bust. Don't worry. We're sure another smartphone crisis will present itself soon. Maybe even tomorrow.
