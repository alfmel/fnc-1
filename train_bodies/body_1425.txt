Apple, of course, has been rather quiet on Apple Watch pricing, aside from indicating that lower-tier pricing will begin at $349 for the Apple Watch Sport models. That being the case, a $150 bump for stainless steel models isn't outside the realm of reason.

Interestingly, iGen.Fr also relays that Apple may still be trying to push for a release before Valentine's Day. This however is at odds with a previous report claiming that Apple is planning to release its highly anticipated wearable device this spring.

As with any anonymous rumor, the aforementioned pricing matrix should be taken with a grain of salt, especially because pricing is one of the few details prone to changing at any time. Still, because iGen.Fr has a rather solid track record with respect to Apple rumors, we felt it was worth passing this particular tidbit along.

On a related note, Tim Cook just last week confirmed that the Apple Watch will most likely have to be charged nightly.
