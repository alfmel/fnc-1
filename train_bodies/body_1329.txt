Several hours after the Canadian Parliament shooting ended, CBS News identified Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as the now-deceased suspect who killed soldier Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at Ottawa’s War Memorial.

According to reports, Bibeau was a Canadian born in 1982. Montreal-based reporter Domenic Fazioli wrote that the suspect’s name is found three times in that city’s court database. “Arrested twice for drug possession in Feb 2004 (marijuana and PCP),” he noted.

Witnesses describe Bibeau as wearing a black coat with blue jeans throughout the shootings, while his weapon of choice was a double-barrel shotgun.

Early reports indicate Bibeau was shot dead by Canadian Parliament’s Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. An ISIS social media account tweeted a photograph claiming Bibeau as one of their own, but neither the image nor the connection have been verified.
