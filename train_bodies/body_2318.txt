The sister of Luke Somers, the American photojournalist held captive by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, says that he was killed in a failed rescue attempt, Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

There are conflicting reports however, with the Reuters news agency reporting that Yemen's Defense Ministry said a raid by its forces Saturday freed a U.S. hostage, who was not named.

Lucy Somers, who said that she had heard the news from FBI agents, said: "We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace," according to a report from Sky News.

A joint military operation to free Somers, conducted by U.S. and Yemeni forces, was launched Saturday, according to a report from NBC News. The network added that Somers' status was unclear.

The reports come just hours after the Associated Press reported that 9 suspected al-Qaeda fighters were killed in a drone strike in Yemen.

Somers' mother and brother appeared in an video earlier this week, in which they called on his captors to “show mercy,” to him.

A video released earlier this week by Somers' captors, al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, showed a militant threatening to kill Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

There has been no official comment or confirmation of Somers' status.
