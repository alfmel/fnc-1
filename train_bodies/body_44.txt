This is the shocking moment a US Marine gets shot in the head by a Taliban sniper – but is saved by his helmet.

Captured on a helmet-mounted camera, the video shows three Marines during a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2013.

Upon hearing gunfire, the team move out to determine where it is coming from.

They travel through a short tunnel and then into another, where they all pause just before exiting.

Without warning, a bullet, presumably from a sniper, cracks against the helmet of one of the soldiers.

“We got a sniper,” the Marine filming exclaims, before the group rush back to protected area.

Complaining that their ears are ringing, they inspect the helmet which was hit before resolving to find out where the sniper is located.
