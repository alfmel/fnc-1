An amateur psychologist seems to have been at work as a vandal on the streets of Seattle, painting a penis on a £1.5million supercar which some might say functioned as a substitute for the real, fleshy thing.

Anyone looking for a metal substitute for their own organ could do worse than the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport: it’s the world’s most expensive production car, and does nought to 60 in 2.6 seconds.

The Veyron boasts 1200hp, more than many dedicated racing cars, but is street legal.

The picture provoked Tony Stark, Iron Man, to claim that the vehicle was his on Twitter.

Yes they were in good condition, besides the fact there was a penis on my Bugatti Veyron…

Or it may have been an impersonator.

Commenters on Reddit exploded in masculine outrage, with many suggesting that you should never draw penises on another man’s ride, or, inexplicably, that anyone who might commit such a crime might well draw a penis on the Mona Lisa.

The real owner has yet to comment.

UPDATE: It has been suggested by some social media users that the image may have been faked, alleging that this is the original picture.
