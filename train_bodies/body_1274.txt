WASHINGTON (WJLA) -- The White House intruder who jumped a fence and made it inside the White House just over a week ago overtook a Secret Service agent and managed to run into the East Room, which is often used for presidential addresses, the Washington Post reported Monday.

Several sources gave the Post a new account of the case involving Omar Gonzalez, an Iraq veteran said to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
The previous account from the Secret Service claimed Gonzalez was quickly apprehended after he made it inside the front door to the White House. But the Post's report indicates Gonzalez made it much further inside than previously known.
The Post report also provided first word that Gonzalez, who authorities said was armed with a knife, actually overpowered a Secret Service agent before running throughout much of the main floor.
Sources also told the Post that an alarm box designed to alert guards to an intruder had apparently been muted, which may have contributed to Gonzalez being able to burst through the front door so easily.
The Secret Service declined to comment to the Post because the security breach remains under ongoing investigation.
