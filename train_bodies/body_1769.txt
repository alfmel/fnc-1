First up, users had sleepless nights over whether slipping their new iPhone 6 Plus into the pocket of their skinny jeans might cause it to bend. And now there’s the very real fear that the new plaything might ruin their hair – or worse, their lovingly cultivated beard.

This phone sure isn’t hipster-friendly.

Apparently, when users try to make calls, hair is getting stuck in the seam between the glass screen and the aluminium back.

And stricken customers have been taking to social media to lament their ruined locks, using the hashtags #hairgate and #beardgate. Yep, this struggle is real.

Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it during calls. #hurts #beardgate

People are joking about #hairgate but this is actually a real problem. Haha. It has pulled out my goatee hairs. Hurts!

So, is this just another teething problem for Apple or is it finally the phone balding men who like to wear baggy denims have been waiting for?
