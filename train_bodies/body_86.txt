The accused Suresh Kumar
They then dumped his body parts and left him bleeding in the middle of the road. 
Stripped Suresh Kumar awaits his punishment
The man has been admitted to a local hospital where his condition is described by doctors as critical. The girl he was trying to rape is in shock and has been sent for counselling. While anybody outraging the modesty of a girl must get the harshest punishment, it has to be within the confines of the law. This kind of street justice must only be condemned.
