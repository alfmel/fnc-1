An unverified photo claims to show the body of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after he was purportedly killed by US air strikes against three senior members of ISIS. An aide to al-Baghdadi were also killed by US air strikes.

The ISIS leader was reportedly killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer.

Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

A number of news outlets and websites have published the unverified photo and news about the death of al-Baghdadi by US airstrikes. IraqiNews.com has been unable to verify the photo and claim that al-Baghdadi was killed.
