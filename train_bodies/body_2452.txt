"It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland," Edinburgh Evening News quoted Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, as saying. He further explained that North Koreans consider Scotland, which leans more towards leftist ideals than England, more suitable to "deal with".
Moreover, the North Korean leader is said to have been keenly interested in Scottish affairs during the Referendum Debate of September 2014, wherein voters decided "yes" or "no" on "Should Scotland be an independent country?".
"Plus, North Koreans love whisky," said Madden, before elaborating, "Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency". The restaurants, if they did open, would serve all nationally popular delicacies, giving the Scots a chance to experience North Korea, without actually going there. 
The dictator already owns over a chain of restaurants "Pyongyang", with international branches including one in Amsterdam. Although the possibility is quite intriguing, an official at the North Korean Embassy in the United Kingdom is said to have denied any such plans.

The official at the North Korean embassy in England denied the claims, saying "It's a nonsense", and refusing to comment further, reported Independent.
