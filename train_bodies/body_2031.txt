Rats still roam at Vogue!
We’re told by several insiders that staffers at the fashion bible are still seeing rodents at Condé Nast’s new 1 WTC digs, which are still under construction.
A source told us editors spotted at least one critter this week under a desk, and immediately notified Anna Wintour.
“They were petrified, and told Anna, ‘We found rats under our desk,’” a source claims. “One said, ‘There’s a rat on top of my desk.’”
But Wintour replied, “I don’t want to hear about it,” according to our source. A different source also told us there’s “still a rat problem” at the office.
But a Vogue insider insisted there’s no rat issue and Wintour did not dismiss employees’ concerns. “That conversation never happened,” the source sniffed.
Vogue was one of the first glossy titles to move into Condé’s new downtown headquarters, but the rodents seemed to have beaten Wintour and her team to the tower’s 25th and 26th floors.
An insider quoted in People magazine in November said, “The girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.” Reports say the magazines have issued an edict not to eat at desks to help starve out any Rodentia.
A Vogue rep declined to comment.
