Rumors have hit social media that the Batmobile has been stolen from the Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice set in Detroit. While on the face of it the idea that someone could actually make off with a Batmobile from the heavily-secured set seem somewhat ludicrous, the local Michigan media seems to be taking the reports seriously enough that the police department has been contacted to look into it.

CBS Detroit notes in their report, “Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?” WWJ950 tweets, “Was The Batmobile Stolen In #Detroit? Unconfirmed Rumors Are Swirling, And Police Tell WWJ They'll Look Into It.”

Of course, it’s a little unclear from the tweet if the police department is actually looking into the disappearance of the Batmobile or is just looking into the source of the unconfirmed rumors. Most sites seem to be pointing to Bleeding Cool as the source of the rumors, which they report as having heard from sources in Detroit.

Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on March 25, 2016.
