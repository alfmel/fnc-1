Macaulay Culkin has been killed off again â€“ in yet another internet hoax.

Back in April rumours surfaced that the troubled star had been found dead. Just seven months later itâ€™s gone and happened again.

Some not funny dudes thought it would be really funny to set up a Facebook page reportedly called Rip Macaulay Culkin and post a message claiming the star had died. He hasnâ€™t, by the way.

Oh LOL.

The group gained thousands of likes and although has since been removed, the news is still doing the rounds on social networks.

The original post is alleged to have said:

â€˜At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.â€™

Reports said that heâ€™d been found dead in his Manhattan appartment.

In truth, heâ€™s alive and well and probably not particularly amused that some hoaxer is claiming heâ€™s anything but.

Naturally the internet is not happy at this turn of events:

I don't get why someone would make a joke about Macaulay Culkin being dead its just wrong

Now internet is murdering Macaulay Culkin. It must be weird to see everywhere that you died when you didn't.
